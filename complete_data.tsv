When it comes to real marriage, human physiology clearly shows that a man and a woman are physically designed to fit together. Science continues to show that there is no gay gene therefore no special rights or laws are justified for those who engage in homosexual behavior. And study after study continues to affirm that the best environment for a child to be raised is with a married father and mother living under the same roof. Government schools and the entertainment media have done a powerful job of teaching moral relativism ad nauseam, while avoiding the teaching of real science and biology on this matter. And with no rigorous critical thinking taught in public schools, it's not surprising that the younger generation is confused about sexual absolutes and numb to societal consequences. The truth has always been, and will always remain, no matter what any law says, that if you don't have one man and one woman, you don't have real marriage.	Con	N	GM

Marriage should be for the procreation of the species, not to satisfy sexual appetites. If marriage becomes about sexual appetite then what comes next? Incest, bestiality, polygamy, prostitution, rape. Secondly, marriage is not a natural right. We cannot do whatever makes us happy. If I want to go slit a dog's throat and put it on a stake, I can't do that because it's not right. It might make me happy, but what does that matter in life?

comargGM	36arg1	Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage	Con	Gay vs Straight marriage is primarily a religious issue.  The marjor religious opposition is based on their belief that God prohibits man laying with man (and note nothing said about women with women).  No gay group are attempting to require any religion to marry them, and there is no chance they could succeed because the government can pass no such law.  Religious groups opposing Gay marriage remind me of how some religions opposed black  and white marriage because they felt it is immoral or a a slippery slope.  But religion and state government is by constitutional law prohibited from controlling the agenda of each other.   None of this has anything to do with the original purpose of marriage, namely to provide rights of inheritance.  In the end the only question that seems  to be ignored is how can two guys married and living next to you affect your marriage?  If some action by others has no effect on your life, why do you have a need to stop it?   How is it different from two straight guys living in he same house?   If marriage is for pro-creation then why not stop senior citizens from marriage.

John Adams recognized the importance of a moral and virtuous society within the US when he said Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. To legalize marriage between gay partners is to legitimize the choice to disregard a commandment of God. However, God will not be mocked.

This is the same book that states that you cannot wear clothing made from two different threads. Jeez, that mean-girl clique in high school always said we were going to Hell for wearing poly-blends, but I didn't think they meant it literally. Jesus was asked what the greatest commandment was, and his answer basically boils down to: Love God, love your neighbor, and love yourself. There is no room in there for hatred, if you claim to be a Christian. But, marriage is only for producing children! So, you're saying infertile couples should not be allowed to marry. Or the marriage of married couples who become infertile due to accident or disease is no longer valid. People like my aunt, who had to have her uterus removed so that she wouldn't die. She's not married to my uncle anymore, is what you're saying. Marriage is what it's always been; the child becomes an adult, leaves their parents, and forms a bond with another adult which becomes the foundation for their new family.

To all the atheist who say the bible plays no part it is what will guide me to paradise. Yes God exepts all sinners but that does not make murder right. I'm a teenager and I know how wrong it is. If I will get sued or be put out of society because of my views so help it but I will go to my grave defending the Holy word. I don't care if I'm killed because of it because I know I will at least see the pearly gates of Heaven.

Stopping the misuse of the current Constitution of the United States of America by claiming the 5th Amendment has anything to do with this argument or that Government should overstep its responsibility to the People, by the People and for the People. The marriage agreement is between two people but should never be used for the benefit of partners to misuse the current rules and laws relating to Taxation, Health benefits or the restructuring of will laws or any related item set forth by State or Federal Government.

comargGM	85arg1	Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage	Con	If we address gay marriage on the basis of religion then yes it is considered wrong. but fact is no two people are going to have the same identical beliefs. some would say there is no  god and others say there is.

Simple reason marriage combines the forms of male and female not just for bearing children but it's a psychological thing.  A guy needs a girl to support him and understand him and listen to his problem; and a female needs a guy to support her and provide for her in ways she cannot provide for herself.

comargGM	93arg1	Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage	Con	In this physical world, which consists of polarity: up-down, positive-negative, left brain-right brain, colors and their complement (ex: black-white, violet-yellow,etc); polarity rules all. The soul of man (created by the creator), invisible to normal human vision because it is comprised of more subtle substance than human flesh, is contacted by the human mother who becomes a conduit, or who touches that (soul) realm (now we know why sex is sacred and so we may understand why some scriptures prescribe severe penalties for RAPE - the victim's soul is interfered with, thereby). Two same-sex people cannot do that ON THEIR OWN. Fertilized egg implants or any type of engineering does not alter the fact that the Mercy of The Creator is NOT extended to them in that regard, nor can they have that type of access.   Now, don't get me wrong.  This is not hate; simply facts as I see them.

comargGM	101arg1	Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage	Con	Legalizing gay marriage has nothing to do with the church, or it shouldn't. One part of marriage is getting benefits from the other. Many married couples never have children but still get the benefits of marriage, should we take those benefits away because they don't have children? Another is the promise to be with each other for an eternity etc. Marriage is also about being able to celebrate having each other. And last, marriage is about being there for each other. Granting marriage to same-sex couples lets them see eachother in hospitals, make medical desicions for their partner when they are unable to and ensure both of the participants safety.

In fact, it is their sexual orientation that ultimately prevents their desire to participate in traditional marriage (not some law or form of discrimination toward homosexuals). There are actually many self proclaimed homosexuals who do currently engage in traditional marriage (and raise families, etc.) This is proof that homosexuals are not restricted from marriage (as defined between man and woman) I truly believe that the powers behind the cause to re-define marriage stem from a stronger desire to attack a religious institution that does not support homosexuality, rather than a desire to achieve the same benefits as marriage for same sex couples.

It is clearly discrimination to not allow gay couples to legally get married.    There are two aspects of marriage:  the state, and the church.    The only thing our courts can legalize is state sanctioned marriage and they should do it ASAP.  A loving gay couple should be entitled to all the rights of marriage.  The other aspect of marriage is the church.  The state can never compel any church to marry a gay couple.  Plain and simple.

comargGM	123arg1	Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage	Con	One of my objections to same sex marriages is that it may give those people monetary advantages intended for normal married couples.  The prime example is that they would receive a reduction of their Federal, and probably State, income taxes if allowed file jointly.  If you go back and study the Congressional committee reports that established the Federal reduction of taxes for married couples, I believe you will find that it was based on the premise that a wife during her child bearing and rearing years will have reduced ability to contribute to the family income.

comargGM	138arg1	Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage	Con	So much talk about discrimination and equal rights, religion and constitutional freedom when what this issue is about is right verses wrong. Is it wrong for a 45 year old man to have sex with a 10 year old boy? Or is that a personal choice that someone should be allowed to make? Is it wrong for a satanist to sacrifice animals in worship of Satan? Or should he have freedom to practice his religion?

comargGM	152arg1	Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage	Con	The traditional marriage that is held in such high esteem is a relatively recent construct, perhaps 100 years old.  Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.  And, to those who might be so concerned:  of the 34 kids that I know (in same-sex homes), 4 are Gay and 2 are lesbians.  That seems to fit within the accepted percentages.  The argument that Gays are mentally disordered is too specious for words.  In the developed world, there is neither a legitimate Medical nor Psychiatric association that would agree with that claim.  The statement from T. Hansen about [t]he accumulated wisdom of 5000 years is germane to nothing.  The social, legal and/or religious definitions of and practices of marriage have varied widely over time.  Each society, each generation has defined the concept of marriage to fit its own needs.  The slippery slope arguments is one of the oldest chestnuts to cause confusion and install fear and doubt.  The cited outcomes of same-sex marriage border on preposterous and inflammatory.  No reasonable person could possibly follow the inane blathering.  Finally, going back to the earliest extant Hebrew Torah, I am absolutely unable to find any text in which God says to Adam and Eve, Okay, first you guys get married and then you be fruitful and multiply.

Getting mad at someone for going against your religion is like getting upset with someone for eating a donut because you're on a diet.

Yes, only a man and woman can reproduce, but some marriages that isn't an option. Should we ban infertile and elderly marriages too?

comargGM	167arg1	Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage	Con	Whether one is homosexual or heterosexual is not due to any learned response.  Both homosexuals and heterosexuals are what they are because nature made them so.  All persons should be treated as human beings. No person should be oppressed simply because that person is different or thinks differently than another person.  The real reason that some people want the14th Amendment repealed, is because treating people equally doesn't fit, Their  Freedom of Religion.  All humans, whether believers or non-believers, deserve the same treatment.  Churches that recognize homosexual marriage are excersing their Freedom of Religion just as much as Churches that do not recognize homosexual marriage.  The U. S.Constitution and several State Constitutions say both concepts are in fact protected Freedom of Religion, and cannot be expressed in a manner that makes one concept superior to the other.  Some of these Constitutions say this expressly, and some imply it through Construction and implication, which is a necessary and proper way to interpret all of those Constitutions.  Making homosexual marriage a moral issue makes it a to be of the Pharisees and Sadduccees that I must be 10 times more righteous than to get to the Kingdom of Heaven.	Pro	N	GM

In this country we've moved at least a 500 years in the last 30 years in our consciousness because of your dogged determination. People are now sensitized to the concept of alternate sexualities and the right of all people to be happy being themselves. But marriage?  Many people cannot wrap their minds around what you are suggesting. .  I propose that ALL unions in the US be termed civil unions. A national mandate, not state by state. Any two adults should be able to unite whether for love, for, sex, for financial stability or for fun. Let the government move out of 'the marriage business.'	Con	N	GM

My point is, in the bible it also says having sex before marriage is a sin and lying is a sin.. how come they haven't put a law on those sins?

A simple lesson in history confirms that the Jews believed in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; the Christian religion came out of the Jewish faith and added the teachings, life, and purpose of Jesus Christ but also held to the God of Abraham, and the Muslim, who calls him Allah, also believes in the God of Abraham.

I believe this is the most the country has been seperated since the Civil War. So So sad.	Pro	N	UGIP

When people refer to any religion, they should be in the situation in which they respect and follow that specific God or Goddess (whichever, one or more) and remain in the boundaries of supporting the land in which they created. If, for example, the U.S is considered a religious country, then if they speak about God, they should consider thinking about what God does for his people, not only what he chooses for being wishy-washy. He can't prohibit something the U.S for being different or because something looks bad or inappropriate as some might say. You can't talk about a specific religion unless you truly understand it, it's not logic for anyone to think like that.	Con	s	UGIP

comargUGIP	414721854arg2	Removing under god would promote religious tolerance	Con	No, the words under God should not be included in the US Pledge of Allegiance because they are completely unnecessary and cause far too much contreversy for what they are worth. The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo. Some people may really enjoy aMayo on their sandwich. But the people who like the Mayo are able to eat the sandwitch without, while people who are allergic CAN'T eat the Mayo.

Unlimited allegiance to a state is not a good thing, as the historic examples of World War II show us. The United States is not guiltless on this score either.

The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic.

Yet when you hear someone say  Amen, Thank God They get a disgusting look upon their face. Like why do people feel it is okay to hate god or a person who has strong religious values just because you do not agree with them? And for all those saying state and church are separate :) foolishness! It may say so in the Constitution and such but it is not fully true. Many churches support governments.	Pro	N	UGIP

The paste or the concentrate that is extracted from the coca leaf, commonly known as cocaine, is indeed a narcotic, but the plant itself is not.	unknown	Coca is not cocaine. Coca is distinct from cocaine. Coca is a natural leaf with very mild effects when chewed. Cocaine is a highly processed and concentrated drug using derivatives from coca.	unknown	support	Cocanarcotic

This ease of extraction makes coca and cocaine inextricably linked. Therefore, because cocaine is defined as a narcotic, coca must also be defined in this way."	unknown	Coca cannot be disassociated with cocaine.

It asks us to recognize all that we share with animals and then demands that we act toward them in a most unanimalistic way. Whether or not this is a good idea, we should at least acknowledge that our desire to eat meat is not a trivial matter, no mere 'gastronomic preference.' Whatever else it is, our meat eating is something very deep indeed. Indeed, if we consider humans to be equal to animals and a part of the animal kingdom, it is natural that we find our instincts to eat meat to be of equivalent intensity as compared to other meat-eating animals. If humans are animals too, why should we deny these instincts?	unknown	attack	Vegetarianism

debate_ext_media	314	The problem with illegalizing marijuana is that it lumps the most moderate of uses of marijuana in with the worst of abuses. Just like with alcohol, there are scales of use that fall within responsible to irresponsible to abusive categories. The responsible use of marijuana might involve the recreational use of the drug a couple of times a year and in very small doses, such as, a single toke. Does it make sense for such innocuous levels of consumption to be illegal? No. And, yet, in states where marijuana is illegal, such levels of consumption are illegal.

But they are not correct if its primary purpose is to protect the inherently procreative relationship of opposite-sex pair-bonding or to protect an intimate relationship for the purposes of its procreative potential. When marriage is limited to opposite-sex couples, there is no need to choose between these purposes, because they are compatible with each other and promote the same goal.

Let 's suppose the Soviet Union does move into Cuba . Suppose they do move in to help Castro .	unknown	What I have advocated is that we use all available commuuications - radio , television , and the press - and the moral power of the American Government - to let the forces of freedom in Cuba know that we believe that freedom will again rise in their country . I will be pleased to discuss the whole record of Cuba with you - how this island only 90 miles from our border fell into Communist hands and the sorry record of administration inaction with regard to Cuba . I can not understand , however , why you wish to place a gag on the press in this final debate .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

If the United States had just had its influence , and at that time the United States was extremely powerful in Cuba , it seems to me we could have persuaded Mr. Batista to hold free elections at the time he was permitted to go and permit the Cuban people to make their choice instead of letting Castro seize power through revolution .

And it is a tragic irony that even while these policies of failure here were being pursued our policymakers received repeated and urgent warnings that international communism was becoming a moving force behind Mr. Castro and the revolution - that our interest and the interests of freedom were in danger - that a new Soviet satellite was in the making .	unknown	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today . Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field .

Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina , Hungary , Suez , Sputnik , the riots in Venezuela , the collapse of the summit , the riots in Japan , the collapse of the Baghdad Pact , the failure of disarmament , the U-2 fiasco , and now Cuba and the Congo ? Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report , the Killian report , and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance : for  Atoms for Peace  was a slogan , the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce , the  open skies  plan was a gesture , and the Baghdad Pact was a failure . Mr. Nixon has presided , in short , over the decline of our national security .	unknown	As the President indicated in his press conference in Washington this morning , there 's no question about our attitude toward Cuba , our determination that there will not be set up a foreign-controlled Communist dictatorship in Cuba [ applause ] but what we must remember too is that the United States has the power - and Mr. Castro knows this - to throw him out of office any day that we would choose , but getting rid of Castro is not the answer alone . We have to remember what brought Castro and then we have to give a constructive alternative to the people not only of Cuba , but to the people of all the Latin American countries , where they can see that there is a way to a better life in those countries without turning to Communist dictatorship to get it . This is what we have to prove to them .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	12	They feel we were correct , I think , the majority of them , in acting as we did with regard to the sugar , the taking away of special consideration that we had with regard to sugar . They thought that was justified in view of the Cuban Government 's expropriation of much of our property , but I think our present course in Cuba has not lost us friends in Latin America . If anything , it has gained us friends .	unknown	Now the issues which face us are not merely to maintain employment in Niagara County , not merely to develop the resources of northern New York , not merely to make a better life for our people in New York State and in the United States . Now the President , and therefore the people , have to be concerned with the Congo and Cuba and Laos , countries which most of us had never heard of 10 years ago , and yet which will affect the lives of everyone here - Guinea , Ghana , countries which were colonial countries 2 years ago , now independent . What they do will affect the security of your children in every school in this country .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	13	Talk about the situation , for example , in Cuba . Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige because he shoots down hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of Budapest in Hungary ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he does not use our great power as he could against Mr. Castro in Cuba and the Cuban people ? But he works with other American States in developing the opinions which will keep the Cuban people on our side when eventually they get the right to choose the kind of government they want to . No; we gain ; they do n't .	unknown	Secondly , also before the threat reached that stage , each of these areas had been visited by Mr. Richard Nixon . Why was not our Latin American capital investment program strengthened in 1958 , after Mr. Nixon was there , instead of this summer at the point of Mr. Castro 's gun ? Why did we not encourage free elections in Cuba after Mr. Nixon was there in 1955 , in order to stave off a revolt against what he called in a Havana press conference in 1955  the competence and stability  of the Batista dictatorship ? Why are we suddenly embarking now on a crash program for African scholarships for students ? Last year we allocated no scholarships at all to the Congo , practically none to other French and Belgian colonies and , indeed , practically none to the continent of Africa itself . We have allocated more scholarships this summer to the Congo than we allocated to all of Africa a year ago .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	14	This also means that we must be firm every place in the world ; because the road to peace is not through appeasement . And the United States , wherever we find freedom threatened , whether it is in Berlin , whether it is in Cuba , wherever it is in the world - we must make it clear to potential aggressors throughout the world that we will stand with the forces of freedom in resisting the attempts to destroy freedom wherever it is . And so we begin with these two ingredients , which everybody would agree with : Military strength second to none .	unknown	Three years ago I went to Havana . I was told that the American Ambassador was the second most powerful man in Cuba . Probably he should not be , but he is not today .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	15	And for those who talk about our prestige , does Mr. Khrushchev gain in prestige because he breaks up a conference , a conference that is designed to alleviate tensions ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he maintains dignity and say I will go an extra mile ? Of course not . Talk about the situation , for example , in Cuba . Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige because he shoots down hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of Budapest in Hungary ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he does not use our great power as he could against Mr. Castro in Cuba and the Cuban people ? But he works with other American States in developing the opinions which will keep the Cuban people on our side when eventually they get the right to choose the kind of government they want to .	unknown	These are the issues which are before the United States and before the United Nations and before the world in the next 10 years . Are other countries of Africa going to join Ghana ? Are other countries of Latin America going to join Cuba ? Are other countries of Asia going to join Laos in the next 10 years ? What contribution can we make to the cause of freedom here in the United States , and the cause of freedom around the world ? I think that is the question that is before us this year . It is not the questions that have been traditionally before us , not the old arguments that divided our party .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	17	I approved of his trip . But who does Mr. Nixon think he fools in the last 3 weeks of an election , who does he think he fools when he says we will have no more debates after this week , as he goes around the country casting his innuendoes , suggesting that we in the Democratic Party are not as devoted to the cause of freedom , implying that for some reason or other we were misled by Khrushchev and he understood him all the time ? I was not the Vice President of the United States who presided over the communization of Cuba . [ Applause .	unknown	And I say to you today that in the affairs of nations , just as in the affairs of individuals , there comes a time when patience , which we have been displaying , is no longer a virtue - and that time is at hand as far as our dealings with Castro and his government are concerned . You will recall that last July we acted to safeguard our future sugar supplies by reducing the share allotted to Cuba . Now we must take further action to protect the interests of the United States and of our friendly sister Republics in the hemisphere .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	18	But if I had done so , that would have been a mistake . Do you know who one of those leaders was ? The present President of Venezuela , Mr. Betancourt , a man who is firmly on the side of the United States , a man who is against the Communists , and a man who at the present time is standing with us in our policy of the Organization of American States with regard to Cuba and in other areas . Now I do not give this illustration to point up any personal abilities on my part .	unknown	We see it in the chaos in Africa . And we have seen communism come to within 90 miles of our own shores , in Cuba . It is up to our generation to meet this challenge - to check the advance of communism , and to renew the advance of freedom .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	20	A major portion of the blame , I say , will rest on Mr. Kennedy , who two weeks before an election has made a statement which not only is provocative , but will be interpreted by the Soviets as an express invitation to do exactly that . And if they do come in you know what the result is ? It can only mean a civil war in Cuba , which the United States would not avoid entering , and this result could easily be spread into a conflict , into a world war , that every American of both parties wants to avoid ; and I say that Senator Kennedy owes it to the Nation to put the cause of peace and freedom before political consideration and to retract this immature , rash , and dangerous suggestion that he has made . Now , some of you who heard the debate , though , will remember that he said :  But , after all , this is nothing new ,  that we helped , he said , the Castro forces get arms and ammunition in the United States when they were supporting their revolution against Batista .	unknown	I think the struggle will be , really , to prevent the spread of Castroism throughout all of South America . Cuba really is an isolated island . The great problem that we face as citizens of this hemisphere is to prevent other countries from following that example .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	21	 It is only when we have a military force strong enough to convince the Russians that they 'll never be able to gain any advantage through military strength , only when we can approach the conference table in a position of equality , only then can we hope for fruitful negotiation . Second , we must establish an arms control research institute , under the direction of the President , to undertake , coordinate , and follow through on the research , development , and policy planning needed for a workable disarmament program . Detection and monitoring systems will require new techniques of aerial reconnaissance and radar surveillance , new uses for our communications systems , computers , and cameras , new ways to denature plutonium and inspect power reactors , and a whole host of additional research projects .	unknown	They want to go Eisenhower 's way - and that 's our way , and that 's the way we 're going . Now , the last point that I make is one that I make particularly because I know of the great concern the people in these university communities have for the cause of disarmament . People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	24	I believe in this . I want disarmament , above everything else . I want peace above everything else .	unknown	Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others . Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	25	Now , when they make a proposal like this , it 's a cynical attempt to prevent progress , that 's what it is it shows that they do n't really want disarmament . Q. Can you estimate how long your disarmament duties will keep you under this self-imposed noncampaigning status ? A. Well , it is n't really self-imposed . It is - would obviously be inappropriate for me to , as the U.S. representative to the United Nations - to engage in partisan politics .	unknown	 It is impossible for us to provide for the disarmament of outer space , the disarmament of nuclear weapons , unless we are in a position of parity with the Soviet Union . This administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament . I think we can do a better job than that .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	26	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	unknown	[ Applause . ] Secondly , we must establish an arms control research institute , working full time under the direction of the President , and their function will be to conduct the research and make the studies on which our position will be based at future conferences which must be held in the sixties , on the important subject of disarmament and on the important subject of nuclear test control , a full time institute manned by men whose mission is peace just as we maintain the Pentagon , whose mission is war . We must also give the same attention , certainly as much , and if possible more attention , to the involved and important subject of peace .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	27	We had no position and we adopted that of the British . Our negotiators had to leave Geneva during the Conference itself to come to Washington to find out what our position was , and again we failed to prepare for disarmament . Throughout the consistent history of indifference and failure the arms race has continued to mount .	unknown	People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr . Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done . We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	29	He criticized administration farm vetoes . He stressed , and I quote him ,  The necessity for the restoration of cordial relations with Latin America  and he called for more effective action against disarmament . The Democratic nominee in 1928 spoke 30 years ago tonight about building a stronger America , strengthening not only our economy but our sense of moral purpose and our public duty .	unknown	I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	31	If we have the ability to meet the problem of an abundance of food , in an imaginative way , that helps people of the world to realize the blessings the Lord has given them , then we assist ourselves and assist others . If we recognize that we do not have much time , that the nuclear capacity is traveling country after country , almost like a disease , until by the end of the next decade 15 , 20 , or 25 countries will have the power to destroy not merely their adversaries , but perhaps human life , and yet this a Administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the vital subject of disarmament and our negotiators have reflected that disinterest . [ Applause .	unknown	That is why , my friends , that is why the President of the United States has been correct in being firm in dealing with Mr. Khrushchev and not belligerent . That is why he has insisted that while he will always go an extra mile to negotiate disarmament or reduction of tensions , that he will never agree to weaken the United States unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also reducing its military power at the same time . [ Applause .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	32	Mr. Khrushchev has stated that he is going to make a special appeal to them . We are going to have a discussion of disarmament . But I do think that in the final analysis that the President should make a judgment as to whether he should attend the United Nations .	unknown	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

political	35	[ Applause . ] The struggle for disarmament will not be easy , but I do n't know any easy struggles in the 1960 's . The struggle for freedom in Latin America , the struggle for freedom in Africa , the struggle for freedom in Asia , the maintenance of the security of Western Europe , the maintenance of our commitments to Berlin , the hope for freedom in Eastern Europe , the development of the American economy , the security for American agriculture - all these are difficult problems , but I do not take the view that they are impossible problems .	unknown	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	36	Our chief negotiator admitted at the 1958 conference on preventing surprise attacks that we , and I quote him ,  had n't up to this time really given the intense study of the kind of measure which would make this kind of measure possible ,  had not even intense study to the very program that they were then putting forward . A year ago when we went to the disarmament conference , we appointed an attorney from Massachusetts to set up an ad hoc committee . That committee met for 3 months .	unknown	[ Applause . ] My friends , I know that many well-intentioned people in this audience might well say , but really , Mr. Vice President , is n't there an easier way ?

political	37	Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands . In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 men working on the complex problems of arms control .	unknown	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing .

As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	unknown	Fourth , while we are working to dismantle the engines of destruction we must work out methods of protecting ourselves against the growing danger of accidental war , through sure methods of informing ourselves about suspicious events or accidental firings so that neither nation can make a mistake which will trigger nuclear destruction .

The great question of the 1960 's - the overriding concern of all Americans and all men - is whether , in the coming decade , the world will move toward a secure peace and the survival of mankind or whether we will move toward war and common destruction .	unknown	 Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace . We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace .	unknown	attack	disarmament

Mr. Nixon leads a party in this campaign that voted 90 percent in the mid-thirties against social security itself ; and in the month of August 1960 , voted 95 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security . I believe in an America where every family can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood ; where children can play safely ; where no home is unsafe or unsanitary , and today there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , and yet , even though our population is increasing , we 're building this year 30 percent less homes in the month of September than we did a year ago - partly , because this administration in the last 15 months has vetoed two housing bills - and we were unable to pass one in this session of the Congress .	unknown	support	medical care,health care
political	43	This time he tries to convince the people that I am against social security . He has continued his misrepresentation of my position time and again when he has told the Nation that I am opposed to medical care for the aged . His campaign from Labor Day forward has been marked by this type of distortion .	unknown	Last month , the cost of living hit an alltime high in the history of the United States , the culmination of a steady rise in the cost of living of over 10 percent .

And I 'm getting tired of having him go around the country and say that we , my party and I , and my running mate , are against medical care for the aged , when it is he who has an inadequate program . We 're for it , and he 's against it , if we really want to lay it on the line .	unknown	[ Response from the audience . ] I want someone to tell me a single piece of domestic legislation that Mr. Nixon ever proposed that stood for progress for the people , from minimum wage , social security - this summer we tried to pass a bill for medical care for the older citizens .

political	47	So , on this particular issue I say that the very fact that I stand against this wasting of the people 's money , that I stand against programs that will not produce progress , but would only produce more spending , indicates an interest in and a concern for your problems - and I pledge to you that I will always have that concern in the years ahead . Now , if I could turn to one other issue , an issue of tremendous importance , an issue of overriding importance , I should say , in this campaign and for the whole world , what could be more important than a job ? What could be more important than adequate security and adequate pension ? What could be more important than good medical care , all of these things which I stand for and for which I have programs that I believe are far superior to my opponent 's : Well , being around to enjoy our good life in this country is more important than that .

Wo n't it be easier just to have the Federal Government take this thing over rather than to have a Federal - State program ? Wo n't it be easier not to bother with private health insurance programs ?  Yes ; it would be easier , a lot simpler , but , my friends , you would destroy the standard of medical care because , remember , we have the best medical care in the world today . We do n't want to destroy it , and speaking here in Rochester , Minn .	unknown	And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system .

He will not be smiling on November 8. [ Applause .	unknown	My friends , too often we think of government in Washington , D.C., as something very far away from us . After all , you elect a President , a Vice President , a Congressman and a Senator ; and the House and Senate meet and decisions are made , but you think , really , that is n't nearly as important as what happens to the prices in the grocery store , to what happens to your schools , to what happens to your medical care , to what happens in all the other fields I could mention . Let me say this , my friends : Today what happens in Washington will affect the prices of everything you buy at the grocery store .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

What we suggest is that medical care for the aged be tied to social security , every working American contribute , and it 's little less than 3 cents a day during their working years . Then when they 're retired , they can draw on this fund and they can sustain themselves and meet their responsibilities .	unknown	Here it is On these matters my opponent is all talk and no performance . Last August he was unable to lead even a 2-to-1 congressional majority to do a single thing he wanted done in the area of medical care for the aged , or any other field where he took a prominent role . Moreover , what he really stands for is a deep cut in the buying power of your social security benefits because his platform and promises will bring on another round of ruinous inflation .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care

The Lincoln tradition of courage [ applause ] is not found in a man who considers Federal aid for education and teachers salaries to be  extreme ,  and I quote him accurately , and who calls helping our older citizens through the medium of social security to provide medical care for their aged life - who considers that to be  extreme .  I do not regard these measures which help our people , including the measure for rebuilding our surplus labor areas , I do not regard them as extreme .	unknown	We say that in the field of education we are proud that we stand for a program that will build more schools , that will raise the levels of our teachers ' salaries , but which rejects the program that they have that would endanger the right of the States to control education and that would , in effect , give to the Federal government the power not only to pay teachers , but to tell them what to teach - and that must never happen in the United States of America . We say that the answer to the problem of health care for our old people is our way and not theirs . Why ? Because ours is a program which leaves to the individual the choice , the choice of what he wants in the way of protection .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

And this administration says , when we try to provide aid to education , when we try to provide medical care for the aged , it is too extreme . When we try to pass $ 1.25 minimum wage , per hour , $ 50 a week [ applause ] $ 50 a week , Mr. Nixon says it is extreme .	unknown	I know that as my mother and father reached their seventies they had some difficult times because of illness , and I know that there 's nothing that touches the hearts of children more than to think of their parents and the problems that they have then . That 's one of the reasons why we have a program in the field of medical care for the older citizens - not one like our opponents ' that would n't take care of 3 million of the people who do n't happen to be on social security , but one that will give an opportunity for every older person in this country who wants health insurance coverage to have it . , but which will require nobody to have it against his will .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	55	And now , if I could spell it out in two or three directions . First , let 's take this problem of medical care for the aged . It 's one that is very close to my heart .	unknown	Medical costs have increased 20 percent in the past 8 years and these rising costs have had their greatest impact on the millions of Americans who are forced to get by on an average social security check of $ 72 a month . Americans feel obliged to help their older parents receive needed medical care but the burden of this obligation strains family incomes to the breaking point . To meet this distress , the Democrats proposed that the medical expenses of retired Americans be financed through the social security system .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	56	Hospitals ? We have built more hospitals in this 7 years than in the preceding 7 years . Health ? We find generally the standards of health care have been improved more in this 7 years than in the preceding 7 years . Highways ? You know the record there .	unknown	This year again only a single Republican in the Senate voted for medical care for the aged . This year again Mr. Nixon , as the spokesman for his party , speaking to 73 million people in our television debate , said that our efforts to provide medical care through social security were  extreme .  But I do n't believe it is  extreme  to help our older citizens get the medical attention they need .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	57	Let me speak now of a more important issue . I am sure when you heard the words  more important  some of you thought :  What could be more important than education for our children , a better job , adequate hospitals and health care , all these things that I have mentioned ?  The answer is :  We can have the best social security system , the best education , the best jobs that we can imagine , and it is not going to do any good unless we are around to enjoy them .  So I urge all of you , without regard to your partisan affiliations , to have this major issue in mind as you go to the polls on election day :  Which of the two candidates , which of the two tickets , do you believe best provides the kind of leadership that will keep the peace for America and keep it without a surrender of principle ?  Here we think we have a good record .	unknown	The kind of a meeting that we had today indicates , I think , that partnership which can exist between the farmers of this country and the Federal Government . Senator John F. Kennedy tonight expressed keen disappointment on the defeat of the Anderson - Kennedy amendment to the medical care to the aged bill .  I am sure that the threat of a White House veto mentioned by every speaker opposing the amendment contributed to this defeat .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	58	[ Applause . ] And this job will not be finished until we provide medical care for the aged under social security . Finally , let me say that I am glad to be here with a young and progressive figure from the State of Michigan , who I believe will succeed Mennen Williams as a great Governor , who will lead Michigan forward - John Swainson .	unknown	My opponent says the thing to do is to have the Federal Government take over and to force everybody , except for 3 million who need it the most , into a system of compulsory health insurance whether they want it or not over 65 . You know what my program is ? I say that every person over 65 who ought to have health insurance , who wants it , should be able to get it and the Federal Government should set up a program so they should be able to afford it ; second , that everybody who ought to have it should be encouraged to get it , but I also say that no one who does not want health insurance should be forced to have it against his will , so that we can maintain the private system in this country which is essential for medical care . So much for these two examples .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	59	In other words , we have here , you see , a program which covers all of our older citizens , including the 3 million not covered by our opponent 's , which forces nobody into the program who does n't want it , and yet which provides more benefits , and a greater choice of benefits than does our opponent . And I 'm getting tired of having him go around the country and say that we , my party and I , and my running mate , are against medical care for the aged , when it is he who has an inadequate program . We 're for it , and he 's against it , if we really want to lay it on the line .	unknown	We are going to have to provide better schools for our children because we need the best educated children in the world . We are going to have to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security , because all the people are entitled to live out their lives in some kind of dignity , and we are going to have to provide equality of opportunity for all Americans . Now , you have to decide which party and which candidate based on their history , based on their statements in this campaign , based on their look into the future , can lead this country into the dangerous years of the 1960 's , which party and which candidate and which viewpoint can build in this country a strong society which will serve as an inspiration to the people around the world .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	60	We provide , under the program that we are offering and have worked for in the Congress , medical care for the aged tied to social security . Mr. Nixon leads a party in this campaign that voted 90 percent in the mid-thirties against social security itself ; and in the month of August 1960 , voted 95 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security . I believe in an America where every family can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood ; where children can play safely ; where no home is unsafe or unsanitary , and today there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , and yet , even though our population is increasing , we 're building this year 30 percent less homes in the month of September than we did a year ago - partly , because this administration in the last 15 months has vetoed two housing bills - and we were unable to pass one in this session of the Congress .	unknown	Schools will he built .

We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	The point is that we pay for that . Every time the President vetoes a housing bill , every time a Republican Member votes against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , every time we are unable to get any support on our bill to tie medical care for the aged to social security , it is not the Congress that suffers , it is not the administration ; it is the people of the United States who require , in my opinion , a progressive , forward-looking government if this country is going to move forward .

If you raise the minimum wage , in my opinion - and all the experts confirm this that I have talked to in the Government - above $ 1.15 , it would mean unemployment ; unemployment , because there are many industries that could not pay more than $ 1.15 without cutting down their work force ; $ 1.15 can be absorbed , and then at a later time we could move to $ 1.25 as the economy moves up .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

political	92	In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .

We have frustrated congressional attempts to develop more missiles , to harden our missile bases , to increase our defenses against Russia 's powerful submarine fleet . We have failed to propose a consistent , comprehensive , and workable plan for disarmament , based on careful preparation and technical studies . And we have been repeatedly reassured by Mr. Nixon - in glowing , sugar-coated terms - that we have nothing to worry about in arms , science , or space - that we have achieved peace without surrender - that statistics showing the Russian economy expanding faster than ours can be dismissed as mere  growthmanship  - and that the anti-American riots in Latin America and Japan were actually indications that the Communists were afraid to face us .	unknown	That is why , my friends , that is why the President of the United States has been correct in being firm in dealing with Mr. Khrushchev and not belligerent . That is why he has insisted that while he will always go an extra mile to negotiate disarmament or reduction of tensions , that he will never agree to weaken the United States unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also reducing its military power at the same time .

All through the campaign my opponent has been trumpeting the falsehood that I , in effect , feast on human misery - that I oppose minimum wage , help to distressed areas , social security , medical care for the aged , and all else that concerns the good of the American people . Last week Mr. Kennedy called me the leader of the social security wrecking crew - trying to secure votes from the aged by playing on their fears .	unknown	Secondly , I have tried in this campaign to set before the American people their unfinished agenda - the tasks which Franklin Roosevelt did not foresee in 1933 - the tasks which Harry Truman could not complete by 1953 - and the tasks on which in 8 Republican years we never even started . We have a minimum wage , but to be of any help at today 's prices it must be raised to $ 1.25 an hour .

At the London Conference of 1957 - the first important disarmament meeting , we were represented by a man with absolutely no experience in arms control , Harold Stassen , and we sent him to the meeting without having formulated any American position . It was not until August 29 , 1957 , more than 5 months after the conference opened , that America had any position at all .	unknown	 Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace . We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace .	unknown	attack	disarmament

I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .	unknown	There are depressed areas not only in eastern Kentucky , but all over the country .

We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	unknown	The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands .

We arm to parley , and we must be strong if we are going to disarm and maintain our security .	unknown	And I say that we can not and should not blame ourselves , our policies , our negotiators , their scientific advisers , or their instructions , for the unyielding refusal of the Soviets to make an agreement at Geneva .

Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	unknown	And the Soviet Union has consistently had the initiative in the eyes of the world . At a time when our relative military strength was much higher than it is today , from 1953-55 , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working full time on disarmament .

This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	unknown	attack	unemployment

Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well .	unknown	Today you are threatening or encouraging further disorders in Latin America , Africa , southeast Asia , Germany , and the Middle East .

The same political party that could vote against the minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 could vote against $ 1.25 an hour in 1960 , and this goes to the heart of the issue , a party which fights progress , a party which is not prepared to associate with it , a party which has stood athwart the great social , international , and national movements of this century , sponsored by Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman - how can they lead in the dangerous sixties ? How can they lead and move this country forward ? How can they demonstrate to a watching world that we are a strong and vital society ?

In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

Do you feel that your children are going to get jobs when you realize that we have to find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years in order to provide employment for our people ? I believe this country can meet its responsibilities , to its own citizens and those around the world , but I think we have to do better than we are doing and that is the issue . Do you agree ? I think you do .	unknown	But we can always do better and I am determined that we shall do better in quickening the pace of our economic advance and in minimizing interruptions to it . I am determined to undertake every sensible measure to that end , to lift to ever higher levels the number of jobs in America , to reduce unemployment further , and to utilize more fully our industrial capacity in steel and other lines To achieve that goal we must release fully the greatest creative force in human affairs - the spirit of individual enterprise in 180 million Americans .

political	138	And now we come to the key question , and one again I want to talk to you very frankly about . Is there any chance - is there any chance - that Mr. Khrushchev will ever agree unless we do agree to give him what he wants , and that is disarmament without inspection ? And my answer is : Yes ; I believe so . I believe so , my friends , because Mr. Khrushchev , above everything else , is no fool .	unknown	The catastrophic arms race , more costly than all of our budget put together , more costly than all the other things which we pay for , can not be eliminated merely by wishful thinking . But is n't it a somber fact that this administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire National Government on the subject of disarmament One-fifth as many as work for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission are working on disarmament in this administration - 100 people scattered throughout the international government . And we can not avoid the menace of a Communist base on Cuba , only 90 miles from our shores , merely by wishing it had not happened , though I wish it had not .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	139	Let me speak now of a more important issue . I am sure when you heard the words  more important  some of you thought :  What could be more important than education for our children , a better job , adequate hospitals and health care , all these things that I have mentioned ?  The answer is :  We can have the best social security system , the best education , the best jobs that we can imagine , and it is not going to do any good unless we are around to enjoy them .  So I urge all of you , without regard to your partisan affiliations , to have this major issue in mind as you go to the polls on election day :  Which of the two candidates , which of the two tickets , do you believe best provides the kind of leadership that will keep the peace for America and keep it without a surrender of principle ?  Here we think we have a good record .	unknown	I refer , of course , to the Social Security Act of 1935 . It is particularly appropriate that we mark that anniversary by the extension of the system to include medical care insurance for our older citizens . A quarter of a century ago , the people of the United States turned their back on the dole and the means test , and chose instead to rely on self-financed insurance , paid through the social security system , to protect themselves against the hazards of old age .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	142	I 'm speaking of the average family . We also want better medical care for our older people , and for all of us as well . We want other things .	unknown	It is a view sharply in contrast with the charity approach , or the demeaning consignment of the aged as dependent burdens upon their families and public relief . The clearest evidence of this difference in approach can be seen in the problem of health care for the aged . Some of the proposals have been founded upon a degrading means test .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	143	I want to make it clear that I come to this section of Wisconsin to ask your support in this campaign with the full realization that the responsibility and burdens of the Presidency will be greater than they have ever been in the past . The whole spread of atomic weapons , the whole subject of disarmament , the whole crisis over Berlin which will hit this country and Western Germany hard next winter and next spring , the problems in the Far East , the maintenance of freedom in Latin America and Africa and Asia , the maintenance of full employment here in this section of Wisconsin , which depends on the paper industry , the maintenance of full employment in Pennsylvania which depends on an outgoing steel industry , the maintenance of full employment in West Virginia and Kentucky , which depend on coal - all these burdens will fall upon the desk of the next President of the United States . The tremendous revolution in agriculture , which has provided a great increase in the production of food and a sharp decrease in farm income - all these will come to rest upon the desk of the next President of the United States .	unknown	Halt the arms race .  Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	146	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care .

[ Applause .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	148	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	unknown	For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	149	I believe the American people prefer their experience under the Democratic Party . Our experience is written in the Social Security Act , the minimum wage laws , the FHA , the REA , guaranteed bank deposits , TVA and a host of other programs . The Bible tells us that  whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .	unknown	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage

Every piece of important legislation of benefit to our people was opposed by the Republicans when they first came into being , away back to the Federal Reserve Board , all the reforms of the Roosevelt administration , social security , all the others , minimum wage , housing , benefits to the farmers , all opposed . Now , with that long history , TVA , the development of our resources , all in opposition , with that long history , how can we expect that that party and that candidate can move this country ahead , with all the changes coming on , the prospects for unemployment , the recession possibly this winter in 1961 , with our farm income down 25 percent , with 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never seeing the inside of a college , who graduate from high school , our prestige in the world being affected , with Communists on the march , Castro on the march .	unknown	Now , let 's look very practically at what happened in the last session of the Congress - this so-called Kennedy - Johnson session . They had a minimum wage bill in that session of the Congress . They rejected this bill , which could have passed , and they tried of course to get through a bill which would have extended coverage to more people and which would have raised the minimum to $ 1.15 this year and to $ 1.25 next year .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage

For he had previously voted to completely remove 1 million workers from the protection of the minimum wage laws and he is the candidate of a party which opposed the first 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage and which has fought against every increase since . 2.

I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	I am most grateful to Senator Morse for his wire . He and I worked closely together in the Congress in this last session to secure the passage of a bill providing $ 1.25 minimum wage . We failed , but I think that we have a chance in this campaign to discuss these issues , to discuss our failures and the reasons for them , and go to the people and ask them to make a decision , ask them to give us a mandate to move this country ahead on all of the great fronts which are traditional , I think , in the Democratic Party .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage

In the case of the minimum wage , we passed out of the Senate by a vote of nearly 2 to 1. That was the $ 1.25 minimum wage .

[ Response from the audience .	unknown	We 're going to have to have more in the field of education .

That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ?

political	168	For peace will not come solely through the conference room and the propaganda machine . Rather the road to a world at peace runs through a revitalized and growing American economy , through the arduous construction of defenses so powerful that the Communists know that peace is their only alternative , through vast research projects to solve the complex difficulties of controlling modern arms , through carefully prepared disarmament programs to be presented by skilled and experienced negotiators , and through the exercise of a firm Presidential leadership which will never allow either our own representatives or the rest of the world to wonder what our position is , to wonder indeed , if we have any position at all , or to doubt the sincerity of our desire for disarmament . Words alone will never impress Mr. Khrushchev .	unknown	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .

But Mr. Nixon had no new program , no new approach ; just the same old tired policies which have resulted in a doubling of unemployment and in a slowing down of our growth until , today , we are growing more slowly than every other industrial nation in the world - policies which have resulted in a steel industry operating at only 50 percent of capacity - an automobile industry which has laid off thousands of men - and a State of Michigan where more than 200,000 men are unemployed and which has never emerged from the Republican recession of 1958 . But the Democratic Party does have a program - a program which will reverse the downward trend of the past 8 years - which will put men back to work and move America toward new heights of productivity and abundance - which will build the stronger America on which the cause of freedom depends .	unknown	In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million .

You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	unknown	No President , no Governor of any State , wants to do anything to risk the stability of the dollar in his own State or the United States , and as a Democrat and Republican with the problems that the United States faces , I am just as anxious as Mr. Nixon . But I do n't think it is possible to move , and I do n't like to see the same old arguments used which attempted to block the minimum wage , social security , housing , the Securities and Exchange Commission and all the rest , programs which now everybody is for , and the same arguments used 25 years ago .

And , so , finally , let 's look at the record , all three , the position on Quemoy and Matsu - slice off a bit of freedom ; maybe it will lead to peace ; the position on the summit conference - express regrets to Khrushchev ; maybe we can save the conference , and then this latest episode with regard to Cuba . I think when you look at these three episodes that this should convince many Americans that they could not rest well at night with a man with such a total lack of judgment as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces in this critical period .	unknown	I think the great opportunity was really denied in 1957 , during the last days of the Batista administration . I was in Cuba in 1957 and the American Ambassador informed me that the American Ambassador was the second most influential man in Cuba . There is not any doubt we had great influence in Cuba , and I think it is unfortunate that we did not use that influence more vigorously to persuade Mr. Batista to hold free , open elections , so that the people of Cuba could have made the choice , rather than holding onto his power and finally driven out by Castro at the point of a gun .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

So I say to you that there is a way to progress , a way in which we can have better education without having Federal control of our education ; in which we can have better housing ; in which we can have improved medical care and medical care and insurance for our older people without socializing the medical institutions in this country , without compelling people to have health insurance unless they want it and giving them a choice , which is the American way of doing it ; a program in which we can have progress in civil rights , which will move forward from the area in which we are presently finding ourselves . All these things we can have , my friends , and , in addition , we can have progress which will create more jobs for more Americans in this great period of the sixties which we are now entering .	unknown	And finally , in 1959 , we passed a bill to provide housing for the elderly , and the administration vetoed it . Lastly , in 1960 , and this is the end of a sad , sad story , when Senator Anderson and I introduced an amendment to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security , do you know how many Republican votes we got ?

This summer , when we tried to improve the standards of social security by providing medical care for the aged tied to social security , again the great majority of the Republicans , over 90 percent , voted against medical care for the aged tied to social security .	unknown	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

The Republican Party for 25 years has put up candidates , and , as a party , has taken the position against every piece of progressive legislation that serves the people , from minimum wage to unemployment compensation , to better housing , to aid for education , to more equal rights for all Americans , for a stronger defense for a stronger and more vital society . The Republican Party , ever since it drove Theodore Roosevelt into the wilderness 50 years ago , has stood still .	unknown	For 6 years in the 1930 's the opposition failed miserably to solve the problem of unemployment . In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million .

Why not a $ 2 minimum wage ? Why not $ 5 ? And here you get the basic economic principles . If you raise the minimum wage , in my opinion - and all the experts confirm this that I have talked to in the Government - above $ 1.15 , it would mean unemployment ; unemployment , because there are many industries that could not pay more than $ 1.15 without cutting down their work force ; $ 1.15 can be absorbed , and then at a later time we could move to $ 1.25 as the economy moves up .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage

political	182	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress .

You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	unknown	No. I think we had to come back . I think it would have been a much bigger mistake for us to say that we were not going to do anything about these matters , and that we were going to adjourn and not do anything about some of the appropriation bills , the Antarctic Treaty , education , housing , minimum wage , and care of the aged , that we were not going to try .

political	183	More detailed study of 15 low-wage industries showed that employment rose in some industries after the $ 1 minimum was put into effect and declined in others . Evidently the change in the minimum wage was not a determinative factor . In order to obtain a still broader view , the study was extended in six communities so as to include both covered and noncovered industries .	unknown	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	184	In order to make good on arbitrary budget promises , they cut back aircraft and missile programs essential to deter a surprise attack and then partially reinstate them when election day nears . This is false economy at its worst , but it is no more false than the detestable charge that I would shift defense jobs from this State to some other area of unemployment . What Mr. Nixon does n't understand is that the President of the United States represents all the people in all the States .	unknown	Five times they have ignored the President 's recommendations and , instead , they have passed two pork-barrel bills of their own , each in an election year , 1958 and 1960 , and each so full of politics they were obviously nothing but veto-bait . The 1960 bill supported by my opponent was so bad , for example , that relatively little help would have gone to the areas of chronic unemployment really needing it . This politically inspired , opportunistic bill would have frittered away much of its assistance on places bearing no resemblance to our few truly distressed areas .	unknown	attack	unemployment

Our hard-hit textile and fish industries - the pockets of chronic unemployment and poverty - the problems of failing transportation - of unfair competition - of economic  old age .  But these are problems which leadership and vision - and faith in the people of New England - can conquer .	unknown	 This letter from this 12-year-old boy sums up the concern that I found all over the United States as we have traveled this country north , east , west , and south . This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	186	The Republican leadership of the Senate knows full well that under the parliamentary situation of these final crowded weeks - and in the political atmosphere of rancor that developed - no significant civil rights measure could have passed . This same political atmosphere has also prevented action on a farm bill and on adequate minimum wage , housing , health care for the aged , and education bills . But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership .	unknown	They talked . But what did they produce ? They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ? Nothing at all .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	187	Another Kennedy hobgoblin - his picture of the Republicans as people who do n't care - is the oldest hobgoblin of them all , but , like all the others , it too can not stand up to the truth . The Republican program for medical care for the aged would preserve freedom , avoid socialized medicine , and reach millions more senior citizens than would Mr. Kennedy 's own proposal . The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children .	unknown	And I do n't blame Mr. Nixon for trying to forget the record of a party which has opposed virtually every single Democratic measure designed to improve human welfare in this century , a party which has not initiated a single piece of forward looking social legislation since the time of William Howard Taft . Mr. Nixon did not ignore party affiliations between elections , when he led the Republican opposition to increased minimum wages , medical care for the aged , aid to education , help for distressed areas , and all the rest and the American people are not going to ignore Mr. Nixon 's party affiliation next week . The third Nixon theme is an attack on the policies of the Democratic Party .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care

We are , therefore , now in a position to further this mounting scientific attack upon disease and health problems by broad general programs directed toward the support of research , training of medical , dental , and other health manpower , and expansion of health care facilities .

political	189	Talk about the situation , for example , in Cuba . Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige because he shoots down hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of Budapest in Hungary ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he does not use our great power as he could against Mr. Castro in Cuba and the Cuban people ? But he works with other American States in developing the opinions which will keep the Cuban people on our side when eventually they get the right to choose the kind of government they want to . No; we gain ; they do n't .	unknown	But in the case of both Africa and Latin America , the hour is late , the world is moving fast , our role and our position have changed , and I do think it is vitally important in those areas and in other areas that we precede events ; that we do not move after them . In other words , I do not like to see the United States offer assistance to Latin America as a result of difficulties in Cuba . I would like to see us offer the hand of friendship to Latin America because of a traditional conviction that the United States can not maintain its freedom unless Latin America is a strong and viable and growing hemisphere .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	190	I am chairman of the Subcommitee on Labor . We tried to put through a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour . The average wage to laundrywomen in five large cities of the United States , and most of them are Negro women , is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week .	unknown	To strengthen our country from within , he promises to move the Federal Government into the very heart of your school system by providing Federal dollars for use to pay the salaries of your teachers , which would inevitably bring Federal control of what is taught . To assure a vital economy , he promises a minimum wage that official studies show would force unemployment and business failures . To protect the unfortunate , he promises to give the wealthiest people in American a helping hand with medical costs in their later years , while withholding help from some 3 million people with incomes of $ 2,000 or less ; in fact , in the name of freedom he would force this medical program on one and all , save the 3 million who need help the most .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage

In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	unknown	It amounts , for a family of four people , to $ 6.50 for a family of four , which amounts to a grand total of 5 cents per person per day , in the richest country on earth . If you feel that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 is extreme , if you believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security is worse than a medical aid bill which requires that an old person must take an oath that he is medically indigent , a pauper 's oath , before he gets public assistance , if you feel it is proper to veto two depressed area bills , if you are pleased by the fact that we built this year in September 30 percent less homes than a year ago , and that this administration has vetoed two housing bills in the last 12 months , if you think that is good , Mr. Nixon is your man . [ Response from the audience .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	192	If we appropriate $ 600 million for defense , the President can impound it . If we pass legislation dealing with the minimum wage or medical care for the aged tied to social security , if the President vetoes that bill , his veto can be sustained by one-third of the Senate plus one and / or one-third of the House plus one . Therefore , in order for the Congress , which is today Democratic , to fulfill its commitments as supporters of the Democratic platform it is also necessary to have a President that can work with the Congress and not against it .	unknown	Some of you may raise a question here when I say this is the most important issue , but I am sure when you consider it you will agree with me . Other issues are important - whether or not we have a good job , the kind of social security that we have for our old age , the kind of medical care that we get , the development of the right kind of school system and all the other things in which all Americans are interested , but you know , we can have the best social security , the best housing , the best jobs that we could possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them . So , this is the issue of our time .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

We say the way to get the jobs and the housing and the medical care and the schools , all the progress that America wants , is to stimulate the creative energies of 180 million free Americans . We say the way to progress is not to weaken the States , but to strengthen the States and the local governments .	unknown	The fact of the matter is that older people in this country , and I am vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Aged , are hard hit by the problem of finding decent housing and paying for their medical bills . Under the bill which the Congress passed , anybody before 65 who needs medical care who has $ 800 or $ 1,000 saved up must first spend that money , exhaust their savings , take an oath that they are needy , and then they will get some assistance .

After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference .	unknown	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	197	There is resentment against the so-called colossus of the north , resentment which we could understand if we were in the same position , I am sure . Now , as far as our program toward Cuba is concerned though I would say that , from what I have learned , from talking to some Latin American leaders and from the reports I have read from our diplomats who have talked to Latin American leaders in other countries , they applaud what the United States has been doing toward Castro , by the strength that we have shown , the fact that we have not thrown our weight around in a way that many would have thought would have been unreasonable . They feel we were correct , I think , the majority of them , in acting as we did with regard to the sugar , the taking away of special consideration that we had with regard to sugar .	unknown	We must be strong in purpose , we must be strong in leadership , we must be strong militarily , and we must be strong economically . It is no accident that the Communists have made their greatest gains from Laos to Cuba to Africa , during the period when our relative strength was in decline , when 1 out of every 16 Americans is unemployed , when 1 out of 20 who is employed is forced to work part time , when great industries like steel are barely working half of their capacity , when , for 7 years , our farmers have been caught in a cruel squeeze between ever-increasing rises in their costs and a decline in their prices , which has caused them to be the most oppressed group in the American economy , when mining is depressed , when lumber production is double and transportation is down , and the cost of living goes up .

Why ca n't we find a bold new program in this area which will make it possible for the Soviet Union to agree ?

He offers promises ; promises that would add $ 15 billion a year to our Federal spending in Washington .	unknown	I think that you know the issues of this campaign well . There is no community in the United States in the last 2 or 3 years that has learned a harder lesson of what it means to live under a Republican administration [ applause ] and an administration which has permitted unemployment in this community to double in the last 12 months .

What could be more important than health care for our older citizens and for ourselves ? And the answer is being around to enjoy all these good things . So I say to you today that the most important decision you will make on November 8 is this : Which of the candidates for the Presidency , for the Vice Presidency , can best furnish the leadership that will keep the peace for America without surrender and extend freedom throughout the world ? [ Applause .	unknown	I have confidence in our ability to close the missile gap , to modernize our conventional forces and to give this country the kind of defensive strength that Stuart Symington has been warning for years we will need if we are going to remain free at the end of the next years . I have confidence in this Nation 's ability to look out for its older citizens , to see that they have a decent pension and a decent home and decent medical care . The people who oppose this program for medical care under social security are the very same people who fought President Roosevelt in 1935 , the very same people who supported Alf Landon in his campaign in 1936 , running on the single platform of repealing social security .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care

This administration , a year ago , in order to get a position on disarmament , appointed a lawyer from my own State of Massachusetts , Mr. Coolidge , who had had no previous experience in the field . After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference .	unknown	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return . I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise . I know that that kind of firmness is what leads to peace .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	214	Getting down to specific problems of concern to business , Senator Kennedy feels that the most effective antidote for inflation is increased productivity and greater production . He advocates a balanced budget , except during times of emergency affecting the national security , or high rate of unemployment . Collective bargaining must take public as well as private interest into account .	unknown	But we can always do better and I am determined that we shall do better in quickening the pace of our economic advance and in minimizing interruptions to it . I am determined to undertake every sensible measure to that end , to lift to ever higher levels the number of jobs in America , to reduce unemployment further , and to utilize more fully our industrial capacity in steel and other lines To achieve that goal we must release fully the greatest creative force in human affairs - the spirit of individual enterprise in 180 million Americans . That effort calls for a many-sided program which I have been developing , and will continue to develop , in this campaign .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	215	We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	unknown	Our negotiators had to leave Geneva for Washington during the conference itself to try to find out what our policy was . Again , we had failed to prepare for disarmament . We had developed no real policy or position .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	219	This is the only method of meeting that test . Opponents of medical care have pretended that it would lead to socialized medicine . Let me make it perfectly clear that I have always opposed socialized medicine and that what the Republicans really oppose is adequate medical care .	unknown	They saved enough that they were able to , but I realize and you realize that for many of our older people , when they get beyond 65 particularly , it 's a very difficult problem they are confronted with when a major illness strikes . Now , the question is : What can we do about it ? My opponent says when he was here ,  Oh , Mr. Nixon is against helping the older people who need medical care .  Now , that is just a complete falsehood .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	222	We have 16 million Americans over the age of 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $ 78 a month . How are they going to get by and find homes , shelter , and medical care ? These are the problems that the United States must face . I am delighted to discuss any problems that anyone wants to raise in this campaign , but I want to turn Mr. Nixon 's attention not only to the coast of China but to the United States and New Jersey and the problems it faces and our people face .	unknown	We want a Government in which , as I noted one of the signs here , we can have our taxes within reason and our prices not skyrocketing . We want a Government in which we can have good medical care , and better schools , better housing . All of these things Americans want .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	223	Now , people disagree with that . Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson believe that the social security route , which would compel all people - whether they wanted health insurance or not - to , in effect , have it through subscribing to social security , is the best one to provide medical care or people over 65 . I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance .	unknown	It is inconceivable to me that anyone could oppose these measures . How can a nation as rich as ours tolerate substandard wages ? How can we justify the absence of a decent program of health care for our older citizens ? Why must so many of our children attend crowded and inadequate schools , and live in squalid homes ? Why must we continue to have unfair and arbitrary restrictions on labor 's right to use its economic power in support of its legitimate collective bargaining objectives ? But , we have just begun to fight . If the American people give us their support at the polls in November , and elect a Democratic administration and a liberal Congress , we will be able to give this country the legislation and the leadership which it so badly needs .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

Congressman Forand , Chairman of the Senior Citizens for Kennedy - Johnson is the author of the Forand bill which calls for medical care for senior citizens based on the principle of social security . As the guardian of our constitutional rights , the Federal judiciary must have at all levels the best possible judges .	unknown	I 'm proud of that record , and we have a program that will produce greater progress and greater prosperity on those issues for America in the future , I can assure you . But may I say it would n't be enough to rest our case there because , you know , you can have the best jobs , the best social security , the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy it .

We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	Yet the average wage for laundry women in five large cities of the United States is 64 cents an hour , and for a 48-hour week .

In the face of such power and determination we can not afford to falter or lag behind .	unknown	I think I should prefer to answer it in this way , the only responsible way .

Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field .

I will tell you , for example , that I think we need economic policies that will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million people , that will increase employment , that we need Government policies , for example , which will provide better guarantees and better protection against unemployment than we presently have . I will tell you today , for example , that I think those policies will produce more economic programs and progress than will the policies of our opponents .	unknown	But northern Minnesota has not been the only area to suffer . This Nation today has more than 126 areas of substantial unemployment - almost 4 million Americans out of work - and 1 out of every 10 Americans struggle to support themselves and their families without any job , or with only part-time work .

Our standards of health care , of welfare services , and of economic security are equal to or higher than those of any other nation - anywhere , anytime . In this development , we have consistently followed two traditional principles : the first , arising out of the heart of the Judaeo - Christian heritage , is that each of us is morally responsible for the welfare of his fellow men .	unknown	We provide , under the program that we are offering and have worked for in the Congress , medical care for the aged tied to social security . Mr. Nixon leads a party in this campaign that voted 90 percent in the mid-thirties against social security itself ; and in the month of August 1960 , voted 95 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security . I believe in an America where every family can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood ; where children can play safely ; where no home is unsafe or unsanitary , and today there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , and yet , even though our population is increasing , we 're building this year 30 percent less homes in the month of September than we did a year ago - partly , because this administration in the last 15 months has vetoed two housing bills - and we were unable to pass one in this session of the Congress .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care

I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned .

The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .	unknown	In the midthirties , 90 percent of the Republican Party voted against a 25-cent minimum wage .

political	236	The Associated Press this month featured an excellent survey by Relman Morin entitled  U.S. Prestige Is Damaged in Asia  - citing our image in that continent as that of a  well-meaning but confused and confusing giant .  To the Asian , this report said , the administration 's policy on Cuba  was a clear case of American indecision , fumbling , and possible weakness .  The events of last summer , the survey reported - the U-2 , summit , and Toyko chain of events -  appear to have shown that the United States was weak , indecisive , incapable of evaluating trends , anticipating developments and formulating action to meet them .	unknown	So , here are two instances .

political	238	Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . Now it is Cuba . These latter two are important issues but I think the American people want and deserve to hear us discuss all the important problems which face our country and to limit the subject of the fifth to one country would be to subvert the purpose of such a debate .	unknown	The question can be stated this way :  What should the U.S. Government do about Castro ?  I favor an economic and political quarantine as outlined in my American Legion speech . Specifically you state that  We must attempt to strengthen the non-Batista democratic anti-Castro forces in exile , and in Cuba itself who offer eventual hope of overthrowing Castro . Thus far these fighters for freedom have had virtually no support from our Government .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	239	Government has tremendous responsibilities , and you , of course , know that whoever is President of this country is going to make decisions that will affect not only the Federal budget , but the family budget , that will affect also the basic issue of all time , and that is whether we 're going to have peace , and have it without surrender , in the years ahead . Now , in talking to those points , I want to first say that certainly there is no issue that is more important than the one that I mentioned last , because we can have the best jobs and the best education ; we can have the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we are not around to enjoy it . Now , I simply think it 's time for us to lay it on the line with regard to what the record is insofar as keeping the peace is concerned , because sometimes our memories are pretty short .	unknown	 But in the next breath he tells us that we ca n't afford to do those things in America that everybody knows we need to do .

political	241	But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace .	unknown	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	unknown	attack	disarmament

No.1, those who are retired , those who live on an average of $ 72 a month under social security .

Such a program will be soundly financed ; it will provide a balanced program of basic health services ; it will relieve the burden upon our hospitals by providing incentives for nonhospital care ; it emphasizes preventive medical care ; and it tends to reduce the overall cost of the program by using less expensive yet more effective medical techniques . Enactment of this legislation during the present session will be a fitting climax to this 25th anniversary of the Social Security Act and mark a historic step forward in sustaining the dignity and self-reliance of our Nation 's senior citizens .	unknown	Let me speak now of a more important issue . I am sure when you heard the words  more important  some of you thought :  What could be more important than education for our children , a better job , adequate hospitals and health care , all these things that I have mentioned ?  The answer is :  We can have the best social security system , the best education , the best jobs that we can imagine , and it is not going to do any good unless we are around to enjoy them .  So I urge all of you , without regard to your partisan affiliations , to have this major issue in mind as you go to the polls on election day :  Which of the two candidates , which of the two tickets , do you believe best provides the kind of leadership that will keep the peace for America and keep it without a surrender of principle ?  Here we think we have a good record .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .	unknown	For under Republican leadership our prestige has fallen so low that our Latin American allies are no longer willing to follow our leadership in the fight against communism in this hemisphere . Second , we must consider more stringent economic sanctions - such as the seizing of all Cuban assets in this country to be used to pay off some of the vast sums which Cuba still owes us . Of course Cuban assets in this country - which were an estimated $ 200 million in June - have declined drastically in the last months as the Republicans have let this potential opportunity slip away .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

This makes you understand that it is n't enough just to pass laws ; it is n't enough just to make speeches , but what you have to do is do what the Attorney General of the United States must do , not just a lot of promises and talk , but get in the leaders of chainstores and get them to agree to break down this barrier so that we can remove this block from the people of this country and our Nation . What about unemployment ? How can you believe me when I say I will move this economy forward , that we will use all the power of this Government to fight unemployment , to fight recession ; but , more than that , we 're going to use it in a positive way to stimulate employment , to open new avenues for expansion of economy ? How do you know ? How can you believe me ? I 'll tell you why . Because I know what it means .	unknown	In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .

You can learn about political science by participating in political organizations , and I would say certainly a political science course under the very able people who instruct you in our colleges and universities is worth while , but particularly to those who want to enter public service , if I could leave just one note - Remember , that while the broad background in the humanities and history and literature would seem to be very remote from the problems of Ghana and Cuba , from the problems of what we do about health care and what we do about the filibuster , remember those are the courses that will give you the judgment and the depth that is needed to react properly and intelligently to these great issues when they come before you years later , if you happen to enter public life . The last point that I would make is this : I want everybody here to certainly feel the necessity for , as I put it , going into politics ; I do n't mean all of you should run for office .	unknown	And this would not have happened in Cuba if the Republican leadership Mr. Nixon represents every step which foresight and experience should have directed them to take - in order to prevent a Communist victory only 90 miles from our shores .

The question will be one of means .	unknown	I think that in many ways the issues are clearer here than they may be in any other part of the United States . I say that because in a very real sense the State of California in the last decade has experienced the same problems which the United States will experience over a period of 50 years , tremendous growth , tremendous economic change , development of your natural resources , the effect of a war economy and a peace economy on this State , the necessity of building new schools , of educating our children here in California , the necessity of meeting the needs of our older citizens , particularly in the field of medical care .

The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	unknown	[ Applause . ] I do not believe that a political party which in the last 25 years has opposed housing and , minimum wage and social security and every great domestic program which has been identified with progress in this country , which has refused to recognize our changing times around the world , which liquidated the credit which Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman built up in Latin America , which has shown itself wholly uninformed of the present revolution now taking place in Africa , which has failed to maintain our military strength , which has given almost no attention to the important subject of disarmament , having less than 100 people working on it in the entire Federal Government , which has permitted us to be second , best in outer space , which has brought less foreign students to study here today than 10 years ago , which has , in other words , presided over the United States in a changing time and refused to change - I believe on November 8 the people of this country are going to take progress for the future , are going to give the leadership of this country once more to the Democrats .

political	253	And finally , in 1959 , we passed a bill to provide housing for the elderly , and the administration vetoed it . Lastly , in 1960 , and this is the end of a sad , sad story , when Senator Anderson and I introduced an amendment to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security , do you know how many Republican votes we got ? One ; 44 Democrats and 1 Republican . And do you know when the vote was announced , a great national magazine said ,  Mr .	unknown	This addition to inflationary government seems to be the one thing the Senator and Mr. Truman have in common . This fact makes the Senator a vocal champion of such programs as medical care for the aged , but in actual fact their enemy . No matter what Mr. Kennedy says , the program for our senior citizens that I stand for will be adopted by the Congress .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	254	I would just add this last point : I do not agree with those people who say that what we should do when we have problems is just to leave them to the States and to the individuals . Now , if the States and the individuals will handle the problems of schools , if they will provide the medical care , if they will do the things that the people want done and that should be done , that is certainly the proper thing to do . But it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to step in where individual or local government can not or will not do the job .	unknown	Those forced to rely on surplus food packages should receive a more balanced , nourishing diet . And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system . The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures .	unknown	support	medical care,health care
political	255	This administration has stood still and so has Richard Nixon for 14 years that I have been in the Congress with him . On all the great issues which disturb our country , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , houses , roads , schools , hospitals , our parties have divided and we have divided , and the great questions for the 1960 's are how is it going to be possible to move this country forward , build its economy , provide employment for its people . And there are 4 ½ million of them out of work today .	unknown	if we want jobs , the way is through peace , with peace , and without inflation .

political	257	Some of you may raise a question here when I say this is the most important issue , but I am sure when you consider it you will agree with me . Other issues are important - whether or not we have a good job , the kind of social security that we have for our old age , the kind of medical care that we get , the development of the right kind of school system and all the other things in which all Americans are interested , but you know , we can have the best social security , the best housing , the best jobs that we could possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them .

He was defeated .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	258	Too often in these discussions of foreign affairs we become obsessed with the problems of the moment . It 's Cuba or Quemoy and Matsu . It 's military power and missiles .	unknown	The whole problem in Cuba is not a dialogue about Mr. Castro . The whole problem in Cuba is what is going to happen in the rest of Latin America , whose side is going to be successful in those areas , which system offers the hope to these people . Bolivia , where the average annual income is about $ 100 a person - are they going to be more impressed by Castro and what he says , or are they going to be impressed by us ? Franklin Roosevelt impressed them not so much because he poured out American money , but because he was a moving , compassionate figure , moving his own society at home , identifying himself with people around the world who also wish to live in the sun .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	259	And on the other side there is the wrong and demagogic way - the right that I have pointed out , the wrong which Senator Kennedy has advocated - and I say this is a way of shooting from the hip on matters gravely affecting the security of the United States . And , so , finally , let 's look at the record , all three , the position on Quemoy and Matsu - slice off a bit of freedom ; maybe it will lead to peace ; the position on the summit conference - express regrets to Khrushchev ; maybe we can save the conference , and then this latest episode with regard to Cuba . I think when you look at these three episodes that this should convince many Americans that they could not rest well at night with a man with such a total lack of judgment as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces in this critical period .	unknown	The difficulties we have had in Panama - this administration has almost ignored Latin America , which was the basic element , support of Latin America , in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt . I believe the next President should reestablish that atmosphere , and working with the other countries [ applause ] and work with the other countries of the Organization of American States to maintain the free spirit within Cuba , itself , and throughout Latin America .

We are , therefore , now in a position to further this mounting scientific attack upon disease and health problems by broad general programs directed toward the support of research , training of medical , dental , and other health manpower , and expansion of health care facilities . This will not be simple or easy .	unknown	Every 4 years the Republican candidate for the Presidency says it does n't matter which party wins , we are all for the same things , we are all for the same goals . Well , if we are all for the same goals , why did the Republicans defeat our efforts to provide a minimum wage of $ 1.25 , and medical care for our aged citizens , and Federal aid to education , and housing to rebuild our cities ? Our goals are not the same , nor are the means the same , nor have they been since Theodore Roosevelt .

Let 's suppose the Soviet Union does move into Cuba . Suppose they do move in to help Castro .	unknown	Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . Now it is Cuba . These latter two are important issues but I think the American people want and deserve to hear us discuss all the important problems which face our country and to limit the subject of the fifth to one country would be to subvert the purpose of such a debate .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	262	Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others . Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring .	unknown	And I say that we can not and should not blame ourselves , our policies , our negotiators , their scientific advisers , or their instructions , for the unyielding refusal of the Soviets to make an agreement at Geneva . The time and patience which we have already expended to explore this way out of the disarmament dilemma have been full proof of our own intentions and those of the Soviets . The blame rests squarely on them .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	263	I think the great opportunity was really denied in 1957 , during the last days of the Batista administration . I was in Cuba in 1957 and the American Ambassador informed me that the American Ambassador was the second most influential man in Cuba . There is not any doubt we had great influence in Cuba , and I think it is unfortunate that we did not use that influence more vigorously to persuade Mr. Batista to hold free , open elections , so that the people of Cuba could have made the choice , rather than holding onto his power and finally driven out by Castro at the point of a gun .	unknown	2. It would , as we have seen from the immediate response of shock and dismay in Latin America , alienate every one of our sister American Republics whose friendship you have acknowledged is of vital importance to our efforts against communism . 3. It would give Mr. Khrushchev a valid excuse to intervene in Cuba on the side of the Castro government , saying that the United States had intervened in violation of its treaty obligations in trying to overthrow the existing government . 4. If this happened , your policy could lead to World War III .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	265	We also want better schools because certainly we think of our children and as good as our opportunities have been , we want theirs to be better . We want better hospitals , better medical care . As a matter of fact , I remember my father always used to say to the five of us when we were growing up , he never wanted to go back to the good old days .	unknown	, or Boston , Mass .

political	266	I realize that line is subject to criticism , because we have a very difficult situation ; but to those who do criticize what we are doing my answer , of course , is : What is the alternative ? There are those who say ,  Why do n't we send Marines to Cuba ?  We could do it and we could give it to Mr. Castro in 24 hours , but getting rid of Castro in Cuba would not get rid of Castroism in Cuba or in Latin America and it would set in motion , in my opinion , a chain reaction of opposition to the United States through the other Latin American countries , which could be very , very detrimental to our foreign policy . That 's why I think the United States , with its great power , has to continue to treat Cuba , as it has , with consideration , always patient , working with our other friends in Latin America , to be sure that they will support our position toward Castro and toward his close association with communism in Cuba . I would add one other thing : I think that Mr. Castro 's very close identification with Mr. Khrushchev at the U.N. will not help him in Cuba .	unknown	Actually , the United States has given more assistance to Yugoslavia since the end of World War II than it has to all of Latin America combined . It is an unfortunate fact that the assistance which was proposed at the time of the Bogota Conference really represented assistance which the United States was determined to give Latin America only when our relations with Cuba soured to the point where we broke off the sugar quota . I think it would have been far wiser for the United States to have held out the hand of friendship 6 , 7 , or 8 years , to help to provide a long-term loan [ applause ] to help provide specifically long-term loans for their capital improvements .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	268	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	unknown	A recent independent survey concludes , and I quote it accurately ,  The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research effort .  As a result , we have been unprepared at every disarmament conference that we have attended . At a time when our relative military strength was at its height , in the mid fifties , at a time when we had the best chance to reach an agreement on control of arms , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working on this subject .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	269	Now , people disagree with that . Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson believe that the social security route , which would compel all people - whether they wanted health insurance or not - to , in effect , have it through subscribing to social security , is the best one to provide medical care or people over 65 . I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance .	unknown	Therefore , I call to you as fellow members of a great organization , as fellow veterans of the past wars , for us to associate together in a rededication to the welfare of our country and that our motto shall be not only  Always Ready  but  Always First .  Senator John F. Kennedy announced today the appointment of a 23-member Board of Senior Citizens for Kennedy to help emphasize to the American people the importance of medical care for older citizens based on the social security principle .  We are going to need effective legislation in this field ,  Senator Kennedy declared ,  and we are going to need effective leadership in the White House to achieve our goal .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care

The Lincoln tradition of courage [ applause ] is not found in a man who considers Federal aid for education and teachers salaries to be  extreme ,  and I quote him accurately , and who calls helping our older citizens through the medium of social security to provide medical care for their aged life - who considers that to be  extreme .

As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	unknown	 Our chief negotiator .

Because if the United States ever enters into a disarmament agreement with the Soviet or with any other potential aggressor which they might break and which we would keep , that would increase the danger of war rather than reduce it and that we must never do .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

Why have you stated that I support a minimum wage which  official studies show would force unemployment and business failures  when there are no such studies , just administration assertion that this might happen - assertions like those made by Republicans every time an increase in the minimum wage is proposed ? 10 .

political	282	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	Under discussion will be ways and means of creating more jobs to take care of the growing unemployment problem throughout the Nation .

I wish this administration had been as alert to that as they now say they were .	unknown	The President was right , right because no President can ever apologize for defending the security of the United States against surprise attack . And then , my friends , the third point you will recall if you heard our last debate , was on Cuba where he said the President was n't going far enough , and where he , in effect , advocated policies that were universally interpreted as meaning intervention in the affairs of Cuba .

Minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation , and in the last session of the Congress in August , when we brought up a bill for medical care for the aged , we received 45 Democrats and 1 Republican who supported it , and we were told it would be vetoed if it passed . I want to say right here that that bill must pass next year , and there will be a President , we hope , in the White house who will not veto it but encourage it .	unknown	They talked .

I mean that we will always be willing to go the extra mile , as he has been willing to go , to negotiate for disarmament , to negotiate for reducing tensions , but we will always recognize that in dealing with the Communist dictators or any dictators , that giving them an inch does n't mean that they will take a mile . They will take the whole world .	unknown	Such an effort requires not only long-term development loans but education , student exchanges , stepped up Voice of America broadcasts , concerned and competent Ambassadors , and a wide range of measures designed to increase the strength of freedom and stimulate the economic advance on which freedom often depends .

We can do this in several ways .	unknown	 This letter from this 12-year-old boy sums up the concern that I found all over the United States as we have traveled this country north , east , west , and south . This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them . 3.

Do you believe we are meeting our responsibilities ? Do you believe that we are sensitive to the changes that are taking place around us ? I said last night in the debate we have less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament - 100 people on the most complicated , perhaps important and perhaps fruitful responsibility which the Government now faces .

Mr. Ambassador , have you had time to catch up today on the Russian proposal for a kind of summit meeting in the General Assembly on disarmament ? A. Yes . I heard about it .	unknown	But I know that there is not one person in the State or Nation who would not like to see the arms race ended - the threat of war recede - and the billions now spent on weapons of destruction turned to schools and hospitals and homes and dams .

political	307	In no area is progress more vitally needed than the area of health . The cost of medical care has skyrocketed beyond the reach of many citizens , particularly our older citizens - and yet the present administration requires them to take a  pauper 's oath  before they can receive assistance . There are too few doctors , too few nurses , and too few hospitals .	unknown	 What are the folks going to do ? What are the voters going to do ? Here 's what you do : First , you look at our record and on the record I say you compare the record of the Eisenhower administration with the record of the administration which preceded it . Both have been in for 7 ½ years , and you can take any test you want - schools , housing , medical care , jobs , wages , controlling inflation - and you will find that in this administration we have moved forward ; we have had far greater progress than in the Truman administration .

The struggle for freedom in Latin America , the struggle for freedom in Africa , the struggle for freedom in Asia , the maintenance of the security of Western Europe , the maintenance of our commitments to Berlin , the hope for freedom in Eastern Europe , the development of the American economy , the security for American agriculture - all these are difficult problems , but I do not take the view that they are impossible problems .	unknown	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

Unemployment is not insignificant to an America which desperately needs the skills and labor of all its citizens if it is to rebuild the strength which alone can maintain the cause of peace and freedom in a perilous and changing world .	unknown	Consider their whole 20-year record . For 6 years in the 1930 's the opposition failed miserably to solve the problem of unemployment . In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

They tell us we 're well off ; then they tell us we ca n't afford to provide our older citizens with a decent program of protection against the heavy cost of medical care . The Republican administration forced upon us a program which refuses medical care to any retired person or his wife , unless they sign away their home , their car , and take a pauper 's oath .	unknown	We 're going to have to have more in the field of education . We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ? It means higher prices , higher taxes for the American people .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care

I think that more and more of the other countries in Latin America recognize what is happening in Cuba and that the pressure of public opinion throughout the Americas will continue to grow and that that pressure can not continue to be resisted by the Government of Cuba . Certainly , in summary , I would say the United States can not tolerate a Communist takeover in Cuba , and I would only say that I do not want to look forward beyond what we are presently doing .	unknown	Mr. Nixon may now say he has been urging an acceleration of our defense all along - but in his August 10 press conference the President said he knew of no such different viewpoint by the Vice President , adding :  Certainly if there is , he has n't come to me about it .  What was the Security Council doing while the Nation was undergoing this experience ? Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina , Hungary , Suez , Sputnik , the riots in Venezuela , the collapse of the summit , the riots in Japan , the collapse of the Baghdad Pact , the failure of disarmament , the U-2 fiasco , and now Cuba and the Congo ? Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report , the Killian report , and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance : for  Atoms for Peace  was a slogan , the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce , the  open skies  plan was a gesture , and the Baghdad Pact was a failure .

But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	316	We must also be ready to reassume the initiative in the conduct of our foreign affairs - or act to spread freedom as well as to react against the spread of communism . We must propose new and workable programs for disarmament , for banning nuclear testing , for reducing tensions in the many trouble spots around the world from Berlin to the Formosa Straits . For only an America which is applying its full resources of imagination and thought and strength to the resolution of the world 's great problems - only such an America will be able to maintain its position as the champion of peace and the protector of freedom everywhere .	unknown	We must never make a concession to them without getting a concession in return . As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	317	And we cared so little about arms control , that we regarded the entire effort as just another branch of psychological warfare , restricting ourselves to propaganda while Soviet armed strength increased . At the London Conference of 1957 - the first important disarmament meeting , we were represented by a man with absolutely no experience in arms control , Harold Stassen , and we sent him to the meeting without having formulated any American position . It was not until August 29 , 1957 , more than 5 months after the conference opened , that America had any position at all .	unknown	We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace . We do n't want anything from anybody else , but remember this : The moment the men in the Kremlin ever have more strength than we have , the moment we ever enter into a disarmament agreement , which would not have ironclad inspection , in which they would gain strength against us , we find that the enemies of peace then , the men in the Kremlin , are in a position where they can do what they want , and that is : They would use their strength to start war . They would use it because their aim is to conquer the world .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

And here you have to have some statesmanship . Here you have to have some responsibility , and I want to say this : The easy thing for me to say would be to say ,  We 'll put the Marines down in Cuba and we 'll get rid of Castro ,  and we could do it in 24 hours .

That is their platform up and down the line .	unknown	And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system .

political	320	In cutting off a carefully limited number of the American goods which can be sent to Cuba Mr. Nixon has made a dramatic but almost empty gesture - a gesture which will have so little impact on Castro as to be almost meaningless . The State Department itself admits that our exports to Cuba have already declined by more than 50 percent since Castro took power . This latest move merely accelerates and aids a long-standing Castro policy - a policy which the State Department itself recognized in its statement this morning - a policy of eliminating all Cuban dependence on American goods , shifting Cuban trade to the Communist bloc .	unknown	As a matter of fact , this talk about the fact that Cuba is lost and that Ghana is lost , and Guinea is lost , incidentally - and they have also claimed that - is irresponsible in the extreme . Cuba is not lost . The fact that Castro , of course , is following a pro-Communist line at the present time causes us great concern , but there are plenty of things that we can do and are doing , and we 're taking some very firm steps , as you know , to quarantine Castro in that area .	unknown	attack	cuba

political	328	But at the present time there is still a chance that the negotiations can result in an agreement in which testing will be discontinued by both the Soviet Union and the United States , or at least not resumed by both , assuming both have discontinued them , and that this agreement will have with it inspection procedures . Now the reason that it is vitally important that we continue to press forward until there is obviously no chance of success is that if we can get an agreement on nuclear testing , suspension of nuclear testing , with inspection , it opens the door and paves the way for disarmament with inspection . And this must be the goal of the President of the United States , whatever party he may be from .	unknown	We can not do that by arguing with him - and we ca n't do that by smiling at him .

Seventh and finally , we must restore full employment to our schedule of national priorities - striving - for a more rapid growth of the American economy - building purchasing power through better minimum wage and unemployment compensation laws - having faith in America 's capacity to eventually provide a productive job for every man who wants to work .	unknown	I know what it is in the little store in which I worked to see a child of an unemployed man come in and have to ask to put things on the bill , knowing that his dad or hers probably was n't going to get a job for a while .

political	331	Now , what does this mean ? This means that we do want progress in this country , and want it to increase , but , my friends , the way to get it is to recognize that the engine of progress in the United States is not the Federal Government , but 180 million free individual Americans inspired by Government . Our opponents say they want progress and they 'll produce it , but you know how they say they 're going to get it ? They 're going to set up a huge new Government program in everything , whether its medical care or schools or housing or anything else , turn it over to the Federal Government , and they say this proves they care more for progress , that they will produce more . But , my friends , the record shows they 're wrong , because those are the same policies we found under Mr. Truman .	unknown	[ Applause . ] And , therefore , the same political party which could vote nearly 90 to 1 against social security in 1935 , could vote against medical care , with only 1 vote for it , in 1960 , or the same party that voted 95 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage in 1935 could be opposed to $ 1.25 in 1960 .

Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well .	unknown	The next President must promptly send to the Congress a special message requesting the funds and the authority necessary to give us a nuclear capacity second to none , making us invulnerable to any attack , and have conventional forces so strong and so mobile that they can stamp out a brush fire war before it spreads . Only then can we get Mr. Khrushchev and the Chinese Communists to talk about disarmament , because having the second best defensive hand in the 1960 's will be like having the second best poker hand .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation .

political	350	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .	unknown	[ Applause . ] Second , peace requires an America that is planning and preparing and striving for disarmament .

Now , as far as our program toward Cuba is concerned though I would say that , from what I have learned , from talking to some Latin American leaders and from the reports I have read from our diplomats who have talked to Latin American leaders in other countries , they applaud what the United States has been doing toward Castro , by the strength that we have shown , the fact that we have not thrown our weight around in a way that many would have thought would have been unreasonable .

He promises to impose a mandatory medical care plan for the aged on every one of the millions of citizens covered by social security , no matter what their personal desires , and leave 3 million Americans with no medical care program at all . My plan would not be compulsory and would provide medical care programs for all those who needed and wanted them .	unknown	What have they done since President Taft ?

Follow the course of being willing to negotiate from a position of strength with firmness , standing always for freedom , but be willing to negotiate on disarmament , on Berlin , on any of the other major differences that we have , trying to work those differences out so that we reduce the areas that might set off this disaster that all of us wish to avoid .

I suppose some of you may wonder : How can Mr. Nixon possibly say that anything is more important than a good job , security for our old age , medical care and the like ? And , of course , the answer is : Being alive is more important . I have traveled to 55 countries since I 've been Vice President .	unknown	Can you tell me what , in the last 25 years , what program the Republican leadership ever suggested that served the people ? [ Response from the audience . ] Housing legislation and social security ? Minimum wage ? All of the programs that serve our people , that advance our country , that provide this country with vigor and vitality , education , security for our aged citizens under medical care under social security , all these programs have been initiated by the party which we lead in this campaign . And as you look at the sixties and recognize the need for new resolutions to new problems , I ca n't believe that this country will entrust the leadership to a candidate and a party that have opposed progress in the last 25 years .	unknown	support	medical care,health care
political	362	And it was extreme for Mr. Nixon . For he had previously voted to completely remove 1 million workers from the protection of the minimum wage laws and he is the candidate of a party which opposed the first 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage and which has fought against every increase since . 2. The job-price squeeze has also frustrated the ambitions of millions of Americans to buy their own homes .	unknown	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	364	Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands . In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 men working on the complex problems of arms control .	unknown	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	365	I do n't think the monetary and fiscal policies which this administration has followed are good enough . I believe that when they stand against the minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , I think they are standing in the way of progress . We have high interest rates and as a partial result we built this year 200,000 less homes than we needed in this country to stay up with our population .	unknown	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position .

political	367	Government has tremendous responsibilities , and you , of course , know that whoever is President of this country is going to make decisions that will affect not only the Federal budget , but the family budget , that will affect also the basic issue of all time , and that is whether we 're going to have peace , and have it without surrender , in the years ahead . Now , in talking to those points , I want to first say that certainly there is no issue that is more important than the one that I mentioned last , because we can have the best jobs and the best education ; we can have the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we are not around to enjoy it . Now , I simply think it 's time for us to lay it on the line with regard to what the record is insofar as keeping the peace is concerned , because sometimes our memories are pretty short .	unknown	It amounts , for a family of four people , to $ 6.50 for a family of four , which amounts to a grand total of 5 cents per person per day , in the richest country on earth . If you feel that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 is extreme , if you believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security is worse than a medical aid bill which requires that an old person must take an oath that he is medically indigent , a pauper 's oath , before he gets public assistance , if you feel it is proper to veto two depressed area bills , if you are pleased by the fact that we built this year in September 30 percent less homes than a year ago , and that this administration has vetoed two housing bills in the last 12 months , if you think that is good , Mr. Nixon is your man .

As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	unknown	And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction .

Such efforts toward personal security , first , are right - not only from the humanitarian viewpoint , which all of us will understand ; they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best , at its fullest .	unknown	I am not satisfied when - Three out of five persons over 65 are trying to get by on cash incomes of less than $ 1,000 a year ; Retired couples on social security are receiving an average of $ 120 a month , and widows an average of $ 56 a month in 1960 when the cost of living is at an all-time high . Eight out of 10 people over 65 suffer from some chronic disease , more than half have no private health insurance at all , and the cost of medical care has skyrocketed .

In the case of medical care for the aged on social security , 45 Democrats voted for it and 1 Republican voted for it , even though Governor Rockefeller had endorsed it strongly and even though it was the most efficient and economic way to do the job . I think the record is quite clear in this Congress , and I think the American people are going to have to decide whether they want a repetition of the kind of negative blocking actions which were carried on in this Congress or whether they want us to move ahead .	unknown	I 'm proud of that record , and we have a program that will produce greater progress and greater prosperity on those issues for America in the future , I can assure you .

The Congress in its last session took an important step in the direction of providing more medical care for the neediest .	unknown	I believe in an America where every child is educated , not according to his means or his race , but according to his capacity - where there are no literacy tests for voting that mean anything because there are no illiterate citizens - where children go to school for a full schoolday , in a well-lit , well-heated , well-equipped classroom , with enough best paid , best trained teachers to give every child 's individual needs some individual attention - where there are enough college classrooms , dormitories , loans , and scholarships to enable every bright student to pursue his education , instead of wasting in lesser positions almost half of our abler students who are unable to go on to college today . I believe in an America where one 's later years in life are the best years - years of dignity and security and recognition - where medical care in retirement is provided for in advance by a few cents laid aside each day of work , under the social security system - where older people can find housing and recreation suitable to their needs - where doors are not automatically shut in their faces by any employer , including the Federal Government - for in these crucial years , we shall need their wisdom and counsel . I believe in an America where every family can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - where children can play in parks and playgrounds , not the streets of slums - where no home is unsafe or unsanitary , on the farm or in the city - where a good doctor and a good hospital are neither too far away nor too expensive , and new research is daily reducing suffering - where modern cities , with modern transportation , enjoy clean , new business districts , downtown as well as in suburbia - and where the water is clean and the air is pure and the streets are safe at night .	unknown	support	medical care,health care
political	390	And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction . But we will not move toward disarmament and a secure peace , we will not be any closer to freedom from fear , if we simply follow Mr. Nixon 's plan for meetings , more conferences , more study groups and discussions .	unknown	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	unknown	support	disarmament

In Venezuela , angry mobs assault the Vice President of the United States .	unknown	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply . And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	392	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	Nor can we permit economic stagnation to continue in distressed areas . The administration has played politics with this issue - as well as with the minimum wage , health care for the aged , school construction , and housing programs . Every worker would do well to remember that the administration twice vetoed area redevelopment bills only to issue later pious protestations of concern and calls for action by Congress .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	393	I want to make it clear that I come to this section of Wisconsin to ask your support in this campaign with the full realization that the responsibility and burdens of the Presidency will be greater than they have ever been in the past . The whole spread of atomic weapons , the whole subject of disarmament , the whole crisis over Berlin which will hit this country and Western Germany hard next winter and next spring , the problems in the Far East , the maintenance of freedom in Latin America and Africa and Asia , the maintenance of full employment here in this section of Wisconsin , which depends on the paper industry , the maintenance of full employment in Pennsylvania which depends on an outgoing steel industry , the maintenance of full employment in West Virginia and Kentucky , which depend on coal - all these burdens will fall upon the desk of the next President of the United States . The tremendous revolution in agriculture , which has provided a great increase in the production of food and a sharp decrease in farm income - all these will come to rest upon the desk of the next President of the United States .	unknown	 Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace .

political	394	Today almost 4 million Americans are out of work and another 3 million must struggle to maintain a decent standard of living on part-time work and half-full pay envelopes . And nowhere has the impact of Republican unemployment been greater than in the 126 sections of this country which are classified as areas of chronic labor surplus , areas where large numbers of men , long out of work , can not find new jobs , areas where unemployment compensation checks are runnning out , where industry has declined or collapsed , where families struggle for the bare essentials of a decent life , where thousands are forced to depend on meager and inadequate Government surplus food packages for existence . These are the rapidly growing islands of poverty in the midst of a rich and abundant America - islands which have been growing in number and expanding in size under the leadership of a Republican Party which is indifferent to the urgent human needs of our own people and which has fought against every effort of the Democratic Party to eliminate poverty and distress in America .	unknown	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	395	But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership . Their aim has been : ( 1 ) To block the minimum wage bill ( which in its first year of operation would have raised the wages of an estimated 1 million Negro workers ) , the aged health care , housing , and education bills ( which also would have meant major advances in the rights of our lower income and minority group members ) . A majority of Republicans voted against the minimum wage bill , all but one voted against social security health care for the aged and not one Republican on the House Rules Committee was ready to let adequate education and housing bills come up for final action .	unknown	I 'm proud of that record , and we have a program that will produce greater progress and greater prosperity on those issues for America in the future , I can assure you . But may I say it would n't be enough to rest our case there because , you know , you can have the best jobs , the best social security , the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy it . And , so , I say peace without surrender , the extension of freedom , this is the great issue .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	396	I have no doubt that the men of little faith who lead the Republican Party will criticize this goal as utopian and unrealistic . Such criticism comes easily to a party whose candidate has said that  unemployment is inevitable  - a party which has allowed the unemployment rate to soar to 5.7 percent - a party which has presided over a continual decline in our rate of economic growth . But such criticism will not halt our efforts .	unknown	Five times they have ignored the President 's recommendations and , instead , they have passed two pork-barrel bills of their own , each in an election year , 1958 and 1960 , and each so full of politics they were obviously nothing but veto-bait . The 1960 bill supported by my opponent was so bad , for example , that relatively little help would have gone to the areas of chronic unemployment really needing it . This politically inspired , opportunistic bill would have frittered away much of its assistance on places bearing no resemblance to our few truly distressed areas .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	397	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	unknown	Mr. Nixon made a speech 3 weeks ago about what we need to do in housing , and he said in that speech the Housing Act of 1949 works very well , that is the basic housing act . Do you know he voted against it as a Congressman ? He leads a party that voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties and votes 90 percent against $ 1.25 in 1960 .

political	398	Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands . In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 men working on the complex problems of arms control .	unknown	 Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ?

Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet . Unemployment is not insignificant to an America which desperately needs the skills and labor of all its citizens if it is to rebuild the strength which alone can maintain the cause of peace and freedom in a perilous and changing world .	unknown	But we can always do better and I am determined that we shall do better in quickening the pace of our economic advance and in minimizing interruptions to it . I am determined to undertake every sensible measure to that end , to lift to ever higher levels the number of jobs in America , to reduce unemployment further , and to utilize more fully our industrial capacity in steel and other lines To achieve that goal we must release fully the greatest creative force in human affairs - the spirit of individual enterprise in 180 million Americans . That effort calls for a many-sided program which I have been developing , and will continue to develop , in this campaign .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	400	A major portion of the blame , I say , will rest on Mr. Kennedy , who two weeks before an election has made a statement which not only is provocative , but will be interpreted by the Soviets as an express invitation to do exactly that . And if they do come in you know what the result is ? It can only mean a civil war in Cuba , which the United States would not avoid entering , and this result could easily be spread into a conflict , into a world war , that every American of both parties wants to avoid ; and I say that Senator Kennedy owes it to the Nation to put the cause of peace and freedom before political consideration and to retract this immature , rash , and dangerous suggestion that he has made . Now , some of you who heard the debate , though , will remember that he said :  But , after all , this is nothing new ,  that we helped , he said , the Castro forces get arms and ammunition in the United States when they were supporting their revolution against Batista .	unknown	Secondly , how is it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union and France and Britain to come to a conclusion to cease nuclear testing with some worthwhile inspection system ? How is it possible for us , who initiated the first atomic advance - how is it possible for us to make a decisive breakthrough in this area ? Because of experiments now going on in Western Germany , it appears likely that almost 20 countries will have an atomic capacity by 1965 . China , Egypt , Cuba - all the rest of them , all possessing atomic weapons , all possessing a hydrogen capacity perhaps all possessing ballistic missiles , and the means of delivering them . When we realize that war has been the constant companion of mankind through the ages , we are about to move into a period of history when any country or combination of countries can destroy themselves , their adversaries , and perhaps the human race , all in the next 10 years .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	401	The question was , Am I for the Forand bill ? I introduced a companion bill to the Forand bill in the U.S. Senate . The Forand bill , of course , puts medical care for the aged under the social security system . We tried to pass a bill comparable to that during the last session of the Congress .	unknown	Let me tell you in a word , if I may why it is of such transcendent importance . I do n't mean that issues such as what kind of Government will see that we have the best job , the best schools , the best medical care , social security , are not important . Oh , I know how important they are .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	402	There is resentment against the so-called colossus of the north , resentment which we could understand if we were in the same position , I am sure . Now , as far as our program toward Cuba is concerned though I would say that , from what I have learned , from talking to some Latin American leaders and from the reports I have read from our diplomats who have talked to Latin American leaders in other countries , they applaud what the United States has been doing toward Castro , by the strength that we have shown , the fact that we have not thrown our weight around in a way that many would have thought would have been unreasonable . They feel we were correct , I think , the majority of them , in acting as we did with regard to the sugar , the taking away of special consideration that we had with regard to sugar .	unknown	And , finally , instead of the hoped-for general relaxation of world tension , the Soviets have stepped up their efforts to create disorder , danger and division . They have established an Iron Curtain outpost only 90 miles from our shores in the once friendly nation of Cuba . They have , for the first time , extended their sphere of influence into Africa .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	403	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	unknown	The man and party who oppose a decent minimum wage also oppose decent wages for our teachers . The man and the party who oppose medical care for the aged have no more compassion for the small farmer or the small businessman , or hungry families here in the United States or around the world . That kind of man and that kind of party likes things the way they are .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	404	But in the two areas , two areas where peace can he won in the field of disarmament and in our representations abroad this country has been ill served . Disarmament planning is the most glaring omission in the field of national security and world peace of the last 8 years . [ Applause .	unknown	We must take advantage of these new technological discoveries , and we must move forward also because the Soviet is moving forward , and we must never let this gap , which presently exists between their strength and ours , a gap in our favor , be narrowed . As a matter of fact , we must increase it , increase it until the time comes when we can have real disarmament with inspection - and more about that later . In addition to this , of course , we need intelligence activities , and I want to talk very frankly about intelligence tonight , because this is a matter that has been discussed during this campaign , as you will recall , in our debates .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	405	And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .	unknown	One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force . His pessimistic talk today recalls to my mind the situation in 1953 when the Eisenhower administration assumed responsibility for the Nation 's affairs .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	406	They do n't care , and I 'll prove it . We have a bill which does it the American way , not one that would have compulsory health insurance that would reduce the standard of medical care , that would compel millions of people who do n't want it and did n't need it to have it , but , one , a bill in which every American over 65 who wanted health insurance can get it , either private or Government , but in which no one in this country is compelled to have it against his will . That 's the American way of handling this problem .	unknown	And I do n't blame Mr. Nixon for trying to forget the record of a party which has opposed virtually every single Democratic measure designed to improve human welfare in this century , a party which has not initiated a single piece of forward looking social legislation since the time of William Howard Taft . Mr. Nixon did not ignore party affiliations between elections , when he led the Republican opposition to increased minimum wages , medical care for the aged , aid to education , help for distressed areas , and all the rest and the American people are not going to ignore Mr. Nixon 's party affiliation next week . The third Nixon theme is an attack on the policies of the Democratic Party .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	407	Mr. Nixon voted against it , every single time , and I voted for it . Minimum wage - I see some signs waved around by great supportcrs of Mr. Nixon . I want to ask them three questions .	unknown	The principles for which Dwight Eisenhower and I have fought and will continue to fight are the ideals not only of Republicans but of Democrats as well . All through the campaign my opponent has been trumpeting the falsehood that I , in effect , feast on human misery - that I oppose minimum wage , help to distressed areas , social security , medical care for the aged , and all else that concerns the good of the American people . Last week Mr. Kennedy called me the leader of the social security wrecking crew - trying to secure votes from the aged by playing on their fears .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	408	Every administration and every 3 or 4 years , this country has to recognize that we must move ahead . So there is one set of opportunities which will be open to the next President and the next Congress , minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , medical care for the aged tied to social security , aid to education , stimulation of housing , urban renewal . These are all programs which have been part of our life for a great many years , really since Franklin Roosevelt 's first administration .	unknown	Now , what does this mean ? This means that we do want progress in this country , and want it to increase , but , my friends , the way to get it is to recognize that the engine of progress in the United States is not the Federal Government , but 180 million free individual Americans inspired by Government . Our opponents say they want progress and they 'll produce it , but you know how they say they 're going to get it ? They 're going to set up a huge new Government program in everything , whether its medical care or schools or housing or anything else , turn it over to the Federal Government , and they say this proves they care more for progress , that they will produce more . But , my friends , the record shows they 're wrong , because those are the same policies we found under Mr. Truman .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	409	This need , still unmet , requires priority attention by the next Congress . The program must be a voluntary one , avoiding compulsory medical care as well as compulsory participation in medical care programs . It would support rather than discourage private medical insurance efforts .	unknown	This is a contest between a party which says  No  to the next decade and a party which says  Yes  as it has in so many years of our history . As long as there are millions of Americans who live in substandard housing as long as there are millions of our older citizens who wait out their lives with an income of less than $ 20 a week , without hope of good housing or medical care in their old age , as long as there are children in this country who go to school on a part-time basis , with teachers inadequately compensated , as long as there is unfinished business in this country , so long is their need for the Democratic Party , and there is need for the Democratic Party today .

political	411	in the first place , we have our responsibilities toward our people in this country , toward the 15 million Americans over the age of 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $ 78 a month . And yet this administration has refused to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security in the same way as they opposed social security itself 25 years ago . But in this area , and in minimum wage and in housing and in social justice , we move in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt .	unknown	That 's what the program will buy for you . A compulsory medical care program - and I will have more to say about that in a moment . A teachers ' program , an education program , which differs from ours in this fundamental : It would take our teachers and put them directly under the Federal Government as far as subsidization of their salaries is concerned , and the net result of that would give the inevitable power to the Federal Government to tell our teachers what to teach - and we do n't want that in Washington .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	412	Why is it that you stand against the proposals for disarmament that are made by Mr. Khrushchev ? Why is it that we ca n't go more than halfway on these proposals and take some of them on faith ?  I want to tell you why we ca n't . Because if the United States ever enters into a disarmament agreement with the Soviet or with any other potential aggressor which they might break and which we would keep , that would increase the danger of war rather than reduce it and that we must never do . [ Applause .	unknown	I think that we have many arms in the arsenal , and one of course is that , and we should keep that second to none . Secondly , I hope that we can try to work out with our adversaries , the Communists , a realistic system with inspection for the lessening of arms tension , for the cessation of nuclear tests and for the beginning of disarmament , and lift that heavy burden from us all .

[ Applause .	unknown	They want to go Eisenhower 's way - and that 's our way , and that 's the way we 're going . Now , the last point that I make is one that I make particularly because I know of the great concern the people in these university communities have for the cause of disarmament .

They thought that was justified in view of the Cuban Government 's expropriation of much of our property , but I think our present course in Cuba has not lost us friends in Latin America . If anything , it has gained us friends .	unknown	But in the case of both Africa and Latin America , the hour is late , the world is moving fast , our role and our position have changed , and I do think it is vitally important in those areas and in other areas that we precede events ; that we do not move after them . In other words , I do not like to see the United States offer assistance to Latin America as a result of difficulties in Cuba . I would like to see us offer the hand of friendship to Latin America because of a traditional conviction that the United States can not maintain its freedom unless Latin America is a strong and viable and growing hemisphere .	unknown	support	cuba

political	416	Thomas Jefferson has often made the point that the greatest guarantee of freedom is to diffuse power and that we must not have concentration of power in an all-powerful Federal Government , and it is because we believe that any kind of program that would put immense power in the Federal Government over our school system is something that Americans should reject , not because of the amount of money that is being spent , but because this kind of power is something which , in the wrong hands , would be something that all Americans would be against . Let me give you one other example in the program of medical care for the aged . We all want better health care for our older citizens .	unknown	His figures are wholly fictitious . But how can anyone figure the cost of the Republican platform ? How much have they cost the taxpayer for the dams and highways that cost more now than they did when they should have been built ? How can you measure the cost of increased juvenile delinquency bred in the slums they refuse to clean up ? How can you measure the cost to their families of the medical care aged persons are denied ? How can you measure the cost every consumer bears in high interest rates - or the cost of an abandoned farms - or the cost of illness caused by polluted water ? How much more are emergency programs in foreign aid costing us because we did not long ago take the steps we should have taken before a crisis was reached in the Middle East , in Latin America or in Africa ? And how do you measure the cost to a country whose security is in danger of being nibbled away by brush-fire wars too limited to justify the use of the massive retaliation our defense budgets have forced us to rely upon ? I do not call that economy . The Republican Party is one of waste - the waste of our human resources and the waste of our natural resources .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

What would that have done ? It would have decimated the people of that island .	unknown	These people will feel they have no chance , and then , of course , they will listen to Castros . So I would suggest that the United States try to develop again the spirit of the good neighbor policy of Franklin Roosevelt , that we regard this as the first line of defense , that we bring in students , that we broadcast in Spanish to Cuba and all of Latin America , that we tell our story , that we help them distribute their agricultural products and resources , and maintain their economy and provide a gradual increase in the standard of living for each person .

Mr. Nixon leads a party which regards $ 1.25 minimum wage as extreme , which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as extreme .	unknown	The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage .

political	423	We had no position and we adopted that of the British . Our negotiators had to leave Geneva during the Conference itself to come to Washington to find out what our position was , and again we failed to prepare for disarmament . Throughout the consistent history of indifference and failure the arms race has continued to mount .	unknown	We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace . We do n't want anything from anybody else , but remember this : The moment the men in the Kremlin ever have more strength than we have , the moment we ever enter into a disarmament agreement , which would not have ironclad inspection , in which they would gain strength against us , we find that the enemies of peace then , the men in the Kremlin , are in a position where they can do what they want , and that is : They would use their strength to start war . They would use it because their aim is to conquer the world .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	424	It involves the lives and security of us all . I believe that we should set up an arms research institute - a peace institute - in the National Government , which will work as hard on the subject of disarmament , work as hard on the subject of peace , as our Defense Establishment does to protect us . We need to be strong , but we also need to be working toward peace .	unknown	We must take advantage of these new technological discoveries , and we must move forward also because the Soviet is moving forward , and we must never let this gap , which presently exists between their strength and ours , a gap in our favor , be narrowed . As a matter of fact , we must increase it , increase it until the time comes when we can have real disarmament with inspection - and more about that later . In addition to this , of course , we need intelligence activities , and I want to talk very frankly about intelligence tonight , because this is a matter that has been discussed during this campaign , as you will recall , in our debates .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	425	[ Laughter . ] As long as 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls graduating from high school never get to college , as long as only the children of wealthy or reasonably wealthy parents can hope to get through medical school , as long as we are producing far less doctors for our population than we were before , as long as we are not developing our resources , rebuilding our cities , moving our economy ahead , as long as we are not giving the same effort to disarmament and nuclear controls that we are to arms and war , as long as science and technology and space and the earth are not being used to make men 's lives more secure , in my judgment we are not meeting our full potential , our full capacity . I come to this ancient city here in Philadelphia .	unknown	In other words , disarmament without inspection increases the risk of war . It 's only disarmament with inspection that will reduce the risk of war . So , I pledge to you that , with my colleague , Cabot Lodge , to whom I am going to give special assignments in this field , we will take the initiative at every opportunity to deal with Mr. Khrushchev and to work out whatever arrangement we can that will provide inspection for disarmament , for tests , for all these other items which I am discussing tonight .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	unknown	The question was , Am I for the Forand bill ? I introduced a companion bill to the Forand bill in the U.S. Senate .

For I know we can do better .	unknown	We must take advantage of these new technological discoveries , and we must move forward also because the Soviet is moving forward , and we must never let this gap , which presently exists between their strength and ours , a gap in our favor , be narrowed .

In the midthirties , 90 percent of the Republican Party voted against a 25-cent minimum wage . This summer , as your Congressman can tell you , in the House of Representatives , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week , for a business that makes more than a million dollars a year , and Mr. Nixon called it extreme .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	437	My answer to that is that it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to put through any program , particularly if the program is controversial and new , if the opposing party uses all of the parliamentary devices that are available to Members of the House and Senate , and if we are opposed by the President of the United States . Now , in the case of medical care for the aged , as I said in my statement , being tied to social security , which I thought was extremely important , as you know in the Senate we secured the support of only one Republican , and we were informed by the minority leader , Mr. Dirksen , when the matter came to a vote , that if we passed social security , it would be vetoed by the President . In the case of the $ 1.25 minimum wage , which was my bill , which we did pass in the Senate by a vote of 2 to 1 , we failed in the conference with the House , after Mr. Dirksen , the minority leader , announced that the President of the United States would veto any bill that had $ 1.25 minimum wage .	unknown	I 'm proud of that record , and we have a program that will produce greater progress and greater prosperity on those issues for America in the future , I can assure you . But may I say it would n't be enough to rest our case there because , you know , you can have the best jobs , the best social security , the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy it .

political	441	Fourth , while we are working to dismantle the engines of destruction we must work out methods of protecting ourselves against the growing danger of accidental war , through sure methods of informing ourselves about suspicious events or accidental firings so that neither nation can make a mistake which will trigger nuclear destruction . Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others .	unknown	People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr . Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done . We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	442	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare . At the London Conference of 1957 , the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties , and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament , we sent a man who had not been active in the field , Harold Stassen , we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position . Mr. Stassen was never able to get clear instructions at the meeting as to what our position was .	unknown	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	443	And I am speaking now of the United Nations , of the Organization of American States - Oh , you know , a lot of people say to me sometimes ,  Why do we worry about these organizations like this ? We 're strong enough . Why do n't we move into the Congo as Khrushchev did , unilaterally ? Why do n't we go into Cuba unilaterally , on our own , instead of working through all the rest of the American States as we have ?  And the answer is this : The United States can not and must not do this because if we are going to have real peace and real security in the world , we must have other free nations and other peace-loving nations working with us , rather than against us . And we must set an ideal - an ideal which they will follow - an ideal that we will work with these organizations to see that things that otherwise would be settled on the battlefield , are settled at the conference table .	unknown	We can not be committed by a party of the past . We can not wait for Mr. Khrushchev 's words , for the Communists are not satisfied with their gains of the last months , with their lead in missiles and space , and their foothold in Cuba , and half of Indochina , and their new influence in Laos and Africa and Asia . They will keep on driving and expanding and gaining without regard to all the kitchen debates and without regard to what goes on in the United Nations unless we have a President and a country in the 1960 's that acts first and acts fast .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

I want full employment in California and New York and across the Nation ; it is Mr. Nixon who calls unemployment inevitable . ( 4 ) Civil rights are not merely of importance to minority groups .	unknown	Five times they have ignored the President 's recommendations and , instead , they have passed two pork-barrel bills of their own , each in an election year , 1958 and 1960 , and each so full of politics they were obviously nothing but veto-bait . The 1960 bill supported by my opponent was so bad , for example , that relatively little help would have gone to the areas of chronic unemployment really needing it .

Now , anyone who believes that under those conditions we should continue that kind of leadership , that supports leadership that twice , not once , but twice vetoed the area redevelopment bill , sponsored by your Congressman , Dan Flood , and your Senator , Joe Clark - anyone that believes that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 is extreme , Mr. Nixon is your man . But anyone who believes as I do that this country will never be strong in the world , that we will never be successful in turning Mr. Khrushchev back , we will never be successful in expanding freedom around the world unless we have in this country a strong and vital and progressive society , and that is what we are committed to , that is what we are committed to , and I believe the American people on November 8 , faced with a choice of a leadership that looks to the past and the present , and recognizing that this country , the only hope of freedom that there is , we are the only sentinel at the gate , and if we do n't move ahead , if we do n't provide employment for our people , if we do n't use our facilities to the fullest , if we do n't educate our children and provide under social security medical care for our aged and jobs for those in between , then the United States , instead of being the leader of the free world , will cease to count as the only hope of freedom .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	447	I realize that line is subject to criticism , because we have a very difficult situation ; but to those who do criticize what we are doing my answer , of course , is : What is the alternative ? There are those who say ,  Why do n't we send Marines to Cuba ?  We could do it and we could give it to Mr. Castro in 24 hours , but getting rid of Castro in Cuba would not get rid of Castroism in Cuba or in Latin America and it would set in motion , in my opinion , a chain reaction of opposition to the United States through the other Latin American countries , which could be very , very detrimental to our foreign policy . That 's why I think the United States , with its great power , has to continue to treat Cuba , as it has , with consideration , always patient , working with our other friends in Latin America , to be sure that they will support our position toward Castro and toward his close association with communism in Cuba . I would add one other thing : I think that Mr. Castro 's very close identification with Mr. Khrushchev at the U.N. will not help him in Cuba .	unknown	He has had an opportunity to study the long-range needs of each area - to recommend new policies for the administration - and to see that those recommendations are properly carried out . What has been the result ? Today , in six key areas around the world , we are reacting too late to a cold war crisis where the cause of freedom is in serious trouble ; in Cuba , where Communists openly plot the disruption of hemispheric security - in Ghana , whose President was assailed by Mr. Herter last week as  very definitely leaning toward the Soviet bloc  - in Japan , where the anti-American demonstrations have already been mentioned - in the area once known as Indochina , where the tiny nation of Laos is struggling to keep its head above a Communist tide - in Poland , where the once hopeful cracks in the Iron Curtain seem to be gradually disappearing - and in India , where the one nation capable of surpassing China for the economic leadership of the Asian continent is meeting one setback after another .

political	455	But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace .	unknown	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing .

We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	unknown	I want to make it clear that I come to this section of Wisconsin to ask your support in this campaign with the full realization that the responsibility and burdens of the Presidency will be greater than they have ever been in the past . The whole spread of atomic weapons , the whole subject of disarmament , the whole crisis over Berlin which will hit this country and Western Germany hard next winter and next spring , the problems in the Far East , the maintenance of freedom in Latin America and Africa and Asia , the maintenance of full employment here in this section of Wisconsin , which depends on the paper industry , the maintenance of full employment in Pennsylvania which depends on an outgoing steel industry , the maintenance of full employment in West Virginia and Kentucky , which depend on coal - all these burdens will fall upon the desk of the next President of the United States .

political	457	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	unknown	In short , no problem is more vital or more urgent in the struggle for peace than the problem of effective arms control . Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

We want the fact of disarmament rather than the fiction of it which is what the Soviets up to this time have been offering , since they have not offered inspection along with it .	unknown	But I can not believe that there is one person in this State or Nation who would not like to see the arms race ended - the threat of war recede - and the billions now spent on weapons of destruction turned to schools and hospitals and homes and dams . With careful planning for reconversion , this State would enjoy a greater boom under disarmament than it ever enjoyed in the cold war . For peace is our deepest aspiration .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	459	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .	unknown	Senator John F. Kennedy today declared that-- the midyear budget report shows our fiscal stake in full employment . Rising unemployment and slack business conditions will cause a loss of at least $ 2 billion in anticipated revenue-- Kennedy said . The failure of corporate profits to rise and the consequent loss of expected corporate tax collections has caused a substantial change in the budget picture .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	460	We stepped up a constant stream of weapons and munitions to Batista - justified in the name of hemispheric defense , when , in fact , their only real use was to crush the dictator 's opposition , and even when the Cuban civil war was raging - until March of 1958 - the administration continued to send arms to Batista which were turned against the rebels - increasing anti-American feeling and helping to strengthen the influence of the Communists . For example , in Santa Clara , Cuba , today there is an exhibit commemorating the devastation of that city by Batista 's planes in December of 1958 . The star item in that exhibit is a collection of bomb fragments inscribed with a handshake and the words :  Mutual Defense - made in U.S.A. Even when our Government had finally stopped sending arms , our military missions stayed to train Batista 's soldiers for the fight against the revolution - refusing to leave until Castro 's forces were actually in the streets of Havana .	unknown	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today . Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	461	Promises for what ? Promises that would go back . Promises that would restore in this country policies that reduced the value of our dollars ; promises that would bring back in this country policies which discouraged business investment , policies which resulted in unemployment , policies which stagnated the American economy . I just want to say in that connection that , as you consider the promises that have been made in this campaign , we all must remember that we pay for them , and as far as my opponent is concerned all that he offers is - what ? He offers promises ; promises that would add $ 15 billion a year to our Federal spending in Washington .	unknown	We are going to have to build a better life for our people . As long as there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , as long as there are millions of Americans who are not even paid a dollar an hour , as long as there are hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work , living on an average unemployment compensation check of $ 31 a week - what do they do when they go out of a job ? Where do they go to work ? How do they keep their families ? How do they pay their rent ? These are the problems that disturb America . How do we maintain our position in the world ? How do we provide fairness and equality of opportunity for all Americans ? I think that on Tuesday my job and responsibility and that of Mr. Nixon 's is over .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	463	I have made another proposal in the health area which I regard as very significant . Health insurance for citizens of all ages has made a major contribution to improve the quality of medical care . In order to accelerate the purchase of health insurance for catastrophic illnesses , I believe that we should be permitted to deduct for income-tax purposes the cost of premiums .	unknown	Therefore , we will build a mobile retaliatory force incapable of destruction by surprise attack , and modernize and strengthen our conventional forces so as to deter limited war . Second , we will act to strengthen America here at home , by working to reverse the current decline in our rate of economic growth and rate of employment , by meeting the needs of our people for medical care , for education , for housing and all the rest , and by assuring every American , of every race and creed equal opportunity in all the activities of our national life . In this way we can convince the people of the developing nations that the road to progress is freedom 's road - that democracy , not communism , offers the brightest hope for their future .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	464	He prepared a report . The report was thrown aside , and this time a New York lawyer without any experience in the field of disarmament became head of our mission . We had no position and we adopted that of the British .	unknown	 Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace . We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	467	There is no sense having a meeting unless there is an atmosphere before the meeting which leads you to hope that there will be some success . On the issues on which we are divided with the Soviet Union , disarmament and Berlin , which are the two chief ones at the present time , there is no indication that there is a common meeting ground . Therefore , just to meet , just to sit down , just to spend an hour , unless there is some basis for hope , particularly as Khrushchev is being extremely belligerent now , I thought the President showed good judgment .	unknown	But he has been standing for the right . He has been standing for peace , for real disarmament , for helping our friends abroad . All these things he has been standing for .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	468	And by that time our chief negotiator had been repudiated by the administration , and publicly demoted from the White House staff . At the next important disarmament conference , the 1958 Geneva Conference on surprise attack , we were represented by a businessman who had been out of Government for 5 years , and who had assumed his duties only 5 weeks before the conference met . Almost up to the opening day of the meeting , we had prepared no position , conducted no special research , formulated no realistic or constructive proposals .	unknown	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	471	Fourth , while we are working to dismantle the engines of destruction we must work out methods of protecting ourselves against the growing danger of accidental war , through sure methods of informing ourselves about suspicious events or accidental firings so that neither nation can make a mistake which will trigger nuclear destruction . Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others .	unknown	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing .

political	474	Physicians and scientists in fields closely allied to medicine have told me how they are already probing below the level of the body 's cells and have begun to explore the molecules in the cells - the fundamental area where both normality and disease are controlled . We are , therefore , now in a position to further this mounting scientific attack upon disease and health problems by broad general programs directed toward the support of research , training of medical , dental , and other health manpower , and expansion of health care facilities . This will not be simple or easy .	unknown	A Vice President who was a Congressman in 1949 opposed public housing , is part of the same administration which in 1959 vetoed two housing bills . Are the people of Illinois and the people of this city and the people of this district to have a change to determine what kind of government they want here in this State and across the country ? Do you feel that everything that has to be done to provide better working conditions for our people and better housing , and medical care for the aged , which affects us all , because we all have someone in our family that needs assistance - and under the bill which the Congress passed and which was signed by the administration , before anyone can get medical aid , they have to sign a petition that they are indigent , that they are broke , that they have expended their money , that they are paupers . I believe in medical care for the aged , nursing care , all tied to social security , which has served our people so well for 25 years .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	475	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	unknown	And even this handful of workers has been scattered through four or five agencies with little coordination or leadership . A recent independent survey concluded : The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research efforts . As a result of this failure we have been steadily unprepared on disarmament .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	476	You have been most kind to do so , and before I conclude - and I have only 7 minutes left out of the 40 minutes , Mr. Hayes , before I conclude - I want to turn to the most important issue of all , and now you people are going to think I really have a hole in my head . How can anything be more important than our jobs , our schools , our medical care and the answer is : being around to enjoy it . What is more important , and the major test , that you should apply in electing the next President of the United States is which of the two men can best lead the free world and keep the peace without surrender for America and for the free people throughout the world .	unknown	But because the magnitude of this problem is increasing , it has reached a point where Government help is needed - and needed badly . In the last session of Congress we Democrats tried to enact a bill to provide for decent medical care for our older citizens under social security . It was a moderate bill .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	477	It 's a typically specious and frivolous maneuver . We have made a good-faith effort to advance the - advance toward disarmament - and make some progress by having a meeting of the Disarmament Commission . Now , when they make a proposal like this , it 's a cynical attempt to prevent progress , that 's what it is it shows that they do n't really want disarmament .	unknown	Only then can we prevent war by preparing for it . Only then can we pave the way to disarmament by showing Mr. Khrushchev the futility of Russian armaments . But let us always remember that Mr. Khrushchev is not going to be impressed by mere words .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	478	They can say we ca n't object to the Soviet Union moving into Cuba under the Monroe Doctrine - we could at the present time - if the United States is attempting to intervene and move into the internal affairs of Cuba . Let 's suppose the Soviet Union does move into Cuba . Suppose they do move in to help Castro .	unknown	The whole problem in Cuba is not a dialogue about Mr. Castro . The whole problem in Cuba is what is going to happen in the rest of Latin America , whose side is going to be successful in those areas , which system offers the hope to these people . Bolivia , where the average annual income is about $ 100 a person - are they going to be more impressed by Castro and what he says , or are they going to be impressed by us ? Franklin Roosevelt impressed them not so much because he poured out American money , but because he was a moving , compassionate figure , moving his own society at home , identifying himself with people around the world who also wish to live in the sun .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

So , my friends , let me say this : We will work for disarmament , yes . We will work to stop tests and get an agreement , yes ; but we will never agree to anything unless we are sure they are going to keep the bargain because that 's how America has got into trouble in the past , and we are not going to make that mistake in the future .	unknown	support	disarmament

You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	unknown	 I think we can do better . As long as there are 15 million American families who live in substandard housing , as long as the average wage for laundrywomen in the five largest cities of this country is 65 cents for a 48-hour week , as long as there are nearly 17 million Americans who are not even covered by the dollar minimum wage , as long as 17 million Americans who are over 65 live on an average social security check of less than $ 78 a month , as long as there is unfinished business before our country , I think there is need for our party .

Now , before we go into this question , many people will say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , are you for Castro ? Do n't you think we ought to support the people that are against him ?  The question is not whether you 're for or against Castro .	unknown	The difficulties we have had in Panama - this administration has almost ignored Latin America , which was the basic element , support of Latin America , in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt .

Why is it that we ca n't go more than halfway on these proposals and take some of them on faith ?  I want to tell you why we ca n't . Because if the United States ever enters into a disarmament agreement with the Soviet or with any other potential aggressor which they might break and which we would keep , that would increase the danger of war rather than reduce it and that we must never do . [ Applause .	unknown	But the hard facts of the matter are that we have fewer than 100 people in the entire Federal Government working on these problems . And the result has been that this country has not been prepared for any disarmament , arms control or atomic testing conference that has taken place since the end of the Korean war .

As a result , we have been unprepared at every disarmament conference that we have attended . At a time when our relative military strength was at its height , in the mid fifties , at a time when we had the best chance to reach an agreement on control of arms , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working on this subject .	unknown	Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done .

And , so , finally , let 's look at the record , all three , the position on Quemoy and Matsu - slice off a bit of freedom ; maybe it will lead to peace ; the position on the summit conference - express regrets to Khrushchev ; maybe we can save the conference , and then this latest episode with regard to Cuba . I think when you look at these three episodes that this should convince many Americans that they could not rest well at night with a man with such a total lack of judgment as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces in this critical period .	unknown	You have developed the technique of having your writers rewrite my statements , using those rewritten statements and attacking me for things I have never said or advocated .

political	497	I feel very strongly on this . As a matter of fact , I introduced one of the first bills providing that all of our older people and others would be able to obtain medical care insurance when I was a Congressman back in the year 1948 . One of the reasons I feel strongly about it is that I have seen what it means for our older citizens , when , after having saved their money , they have retired and are living on a very small income , to have tremendous medical expenses hit them .	unknown	The overall increase in the cost of living has been only about 22 percent . For medical care it has been 35 percent , for rent 30 percent , for the general costs , particularly in the heavy industries , it has gone up more than 30 percent . This is a serious problem , not only to our own people who are adversely affected by a steady increase in their cost of living , but it is also a serious problem in our attempts to compete in other markets , in automobiles , in steel , in heavy construction .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	500	Vocational training and other educational programs are prime cases in point , where we can buy invaluable lead-time against the problems of the aged by starting with persons of middle age . One of the most important preventives of all would be to accelerate the use of private medical care insurance programs which would enable people of working age to take adequate action to safeguard their health . I think we should give immediate consideration to allowing tax deductions for the cost of health insurance , designed to protect them against catastrophic illnesses that place crippling burdens on our families .	unknown	As this campaign enters its final week , the Republicans are stepping up their efforts to convince the voters to forget party labels , party records , and party differences . The American voter , however , will have no trouble in making a clear choice if he keeps in mind at least six basic areas of disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself : ( 1 ) Medical care for the aged : The Republican plan permits only a handfuT of retired workers to receive public assistance for medical care if they are willing to surrender their dignity by taking a  pauper 's oath .  The Democratic plan would permit this cost to be covered under our social security system , so that all workers may set aside a few cents every day during their working years to help pay their medical bills when their earning power is gone .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care

As far as the interim period is concerned , of course we have got - we must handle our unemployment insurance in a way that it will adequately cover all of those who are unemployed , and we must extend the system - and I have advocated this - extend the system to fill some of the loopholes that presently exist .

political	508	In a message to Congress on January 7 , 1941 , President Roosevelt translated freedom from fear to mean  a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor anywhere in the world .  In short , freedom from fear was freedom from war - the pursuit of that freedom was the pursuit of peace - the method of achieving that freedom was the method of disarmament . Today , 20 years later , we are still far from Franklin Roosevelt 's goal .	unknown	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

But , you know , my friends , we can have all these things , the best jobs in the world , the best medical care and the best schools , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them . So , the first responsibility of a President of the United States , I say , is to provide the leadership that will keep America at peace and will extend freedom throughout the world .	unknown	Let me make it very clear what I would like this country to be at the end of the next 4 years or 8 years . I would like it to be said that in our administration , if we are successful , in the next 4 or 8 years , that our country moved here at home , it began to solve the problems that face our people , it put special emphasis on education , because no free society can survive without the best educational system in the world , it took care of our children and gave attention to the medical care for the aged . So that our older citizens could live out their lives in some security .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	511	The second bill that was up and which is an issue in this campaign was a bill to provide $ 1.25 minimum wage . Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it . I think these issues are important , not because the minimum wage is maybe the most important issue in the United States today , and not because medical care for the aged itself may be the most important issue , and not because aid to education itself may be the most important issue .	unknown	They talked .

political	512	Unfortunately , a life of health , dignity , and independence in retirement has not been realized by millions of America 's senior citizens . The pioneering , exhaustive studies of the Senate Subcommittee on Problems of the Aged and Aging , led by Senator McNamara of Michigan and Senator Kennedy , provide conclusive statistical and human evidence that at least half of those over 65 - 8 million older Americans : have income inadequate for good nutrition and ordinary living ; have serious health problems and even more serious problems of paying for medical care . In addition , too many of the aged and aging : face discrimination in eniployment because of age ; have unsuitable , often unbearable , housing conditions ; have little recreation , too often resulting in isolation and mental disturbance .	unknown	I feel very strongly on this . As a matter of fact , I introduced one of the first bills providing that all of our older people and others would be able to obtain medical care insurance when I was a Congressman back in the year 1948 . One of the reasons I feel strongly about it is that I have seen what it means for our older citizens , when , after having saved their money , they have retired and are living on a very small income , to have tremendous medical expenses hit them .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world .

But Mr. Nixon had no new program , no new approach ; just the same old tired policies which have resulted in a doubling of unemployment and in a slowing down of our growth until , today , we are growing more slowly than every other industrial nation in the world - policies which have resulted in a steel industry operating at only 50 percent of capacity - an automobile industry which has laid off thousands of men - and a State of Michigan where more than 200,000 men are unemployed and which has never emerged from the Republican recession of 1958 . But the Democratic Party does have a program - a program which will reverse the downward trend of the past 8 years - which will put men back to work and move America toward new heights of productivity and abundance - which will build the stronger America on which the cause of freedom depends .	unknown	That was the Truman recession of 1949 .

As President Eisenhower has indicated time and time again , the United States can not tolerate Russian influence or a Russian-dominated government in Cuba or in the Americas .

But any citizen of this community and any citizen of Indiana who believes that the balance of power in the world is not moving in our direction , who is concerned about the rise of Castro in Cuba , and the spread of his power through all of Latin America , who is concerned that the nations of Africa are not following our road but one of nentrality and one of increasing friendship with the Communists , who believes that the economy of this country is moving at a slow rate , who sees that we are only using 50 percent of our steel capacity , only 50 percent - last week the Soviet Union outproduced us in steel , though they have one-half of the potential we do , because we are only using 54 percent of our capacity . Corn is down , steel mills are at 50 percent , a recession in 1958 , and already less than 2 years later , we find the economy in the fall which should be our best time moving at a slower rate of growth than it should .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

We provide more benefits , and I 'm particularly glad to get this question because there is no more vicious statement that 's been made in this campaign by Senator Kennedy and some of his colleagues than that we oppose medical care for the aged . It is they who have an inadequate program .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	547	The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .	unknown	[ Applause . ] The Republican Party has never broken through new ground , has never stood for progress , has opposed step by step every piece of progressive legislation passed for the benefit of the people in the last 25 years , housing , social security , minimum wage , unemployment compensation - all of the things which make it possible for us to build a strong and vital society . I ask you to join us in 1960 .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	549	Rather , I believe they will elect a candidate whose own philosophy and that of his party - the Democratic Party - has been consistent in the people 's interest at home and abroad . Mr. Nixon can call it practical progressivism or economic conservatism , but the label does not hide the package - which has been Mr. Nixon 's and the Republican Party 's constant opposition to meeting the needs of our people , opposition to $ 1.25 minimum wage , opposition to aid to education , opposition to medical care for the aged under social security , opposition to decent housing , opposition to adequate aid to the Nation 's depressed areas . Mr. Nixon can apply any label be wants to this record , but the record speaks far more eloquently than his changing definitions , tailored to suit the needs of his audiences , one label for the South , another for the North , another for the West , and still another for the East .	unknown	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	550	It 's been done , incidentally , over the objection of some well-intentioned , but hopelessly naive Castro apologists within the United States - and all that I can say with regard to Senator Kennedy 's position is that he apparently is attempting to obscure his association with the views of this pro-Castro group as indicated in the book that I mentioned a moment ago or he must have thought now that there would be political advantage in taking a stronger position than I have taken , a radical position , instead of the strong and sound position that the administration has taken . And , so , what does he suggest ? He comes up , as I pointed up , with the fantastic recommendation that the U.S. Government shall directly aid the anti-Castro forces both in and out of Cuba . Now , every freedom-loving person in the United States - let 's make it clear - is in sympathy with the democratic anti-Castro forces in Cuba and outside Cuba .	unknown	You have developed the technique of having your writers rewrite my statements , using those rewritten statements and attacking me for things I have never said or advocated . This is certainly the record with regard to the speeches you have been making in the past 45 hours on Cuba . I have never advocated and I do not now advocate intervention in Cuba in violation of our treaty obligations and in fact stated in Johnstown , Pa .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	552	Now , before we go into this question , many people will say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , are you for Castro ? Do n't you think we ought to support the people that are against him ?  The question is not whether you 're for or against Castro . The question is : What do you do ? What can you properly do ? What can the great United States of America legally and properly do to help the people of Cuba get the kind of government they deserve ? And this is n't easy . It is n't the easy shooting-from-the-hip way that Senator Kennedy has suggested .	unknown	I was in Cuba in 1957 and the American Ambassador informed me that the American Ambassador was the second most influential man in Cuba . There is not any doubt we had great influence in Cuba , and I think it is unfortunate that we did not use that influence more vigorously to persuade Mr. Batista to hold free , open elections , so that the people of Cuba could have made the choice , rather than holding onto his power and finally driven out by Castro at the point of a gun . Mr. Castro is now a Communist .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	553	And what did my opponent say ? Oh , he said , it is n't enough . He said the American Government should give support to the forces inside and outside of Cuba that were against Castro . That sounded good , did n't it ? But , you know what it meant ? That would have violated the treaties we had with all the Latin American States .	unknown	These people will feel they have no chance , and then , of course , they will listen to Castros . So I would suggest that the United States try to develop again the spirit of the good neighbor policy of Franklin Roosevelt , that we regard this as the first line of defense , that we bring in students , that we broadcast in Spanish to Cuba and all of Latin America , that we tell our story , that we help them distribute their agricultural products and resources , and maintain their economy and provide a gradual increase in the standard of living for each person . This is the key to Latin America .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	554	He has announced that he is going to spend the next 3 weeks talking of those two islands , about which there is no debate . Every week , once , I would like to have him tell us about Cuba . I would like to have him tell us [ applause ] - we do n't want it often , but I would like to have him tell us what he is going to do .	unknown	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply . And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	555	Oh , the problems are great . In Cuba , in the Congo , in the Near East , all over the world , there are problems with which we are confronted and we will continue to be confronted with them in the years ahead . But the opportunities are even greater .	unknown	The United Nations can not force a solution in the Congo , but they can prevent Russians or Chinese Communists from infiltrating and using the present crises in the Congo as a method of securing power . Secondly , in the case of Cuba , I think the basic error was made in the last stage of Batista , when we did not use our great influence which we had then to persuade Batista to permit free elections and a return to constitutional government , and let the Cuban people pick his successor , instead of letting Castro seize it in almost a palace revolution . Thirdly , I think that in the problem of Cuba we have to work with the other - the Organization of the American States , and I am most concerned , not only that we isolate Cuba , but that we attempt to isolate the Cuban revolution from the rest of South America .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	556	It has dismayed our friends . It has given grist to the mill to those who are our potential enemies around the world , because he suggested that the U.S. Government should support the anti-Castro forces in and out of Cuba . This sounds so well intentioned , because , after all , we all do n't like Castro .	unknown	[ Laughter . ] First , he wanted to discuss just Cuba , and we said ,  Well , we thought we ought to discuss some other subjects .  Then he wanted the vice presidential candidates in there , and I said that was fine .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	557	It will meet it honestly . It will do a better job , and I resent the attacks of our opponents when they say we are against health care for the aged and they 're for it because , as I will tell you , we are for the only program that will do the job , and theirs wo n't do the job , and it 's time that they be called on it . Look at the problem , and this is an indication of how we approach these problems .	unknown	( Response from the audience . ) Mr. Nixon considers medical care for the aged tied to social security to be , and I quote him accurately ,  too extreme .  There are 17 million Americans and there is not anyone here who does not have a part of his family or he , himself or she , herself , will be some day in the same position .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	558	You can sum it up in five words : The Republicans have vetoed Pennsylvania . The Democratic Congress passed two area development bills to help create jobs in areas of heavy and persistent unemployment . All of western Pennsylvania , including this county , would have been eligible .	unknown	In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million . Let 's face it : It took war to solve the unemployment riddle for them . After the war was over opposition spokesmen forecast some 6 million unemployed .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	559	This administration , a year ago , in order to get a position on disarmament , appointed a lawyer from my own State of Massachusetts , Mr. Coolidge , who had had no previous experience in the field . After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference . One hundred people working on one of the most important , involved , specialized fields the subject of disarmament , nuclear control .	unknown	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	561	I refer , of course , to the Social Security Act of 1935 . It is particularly appropriate that we mark that anniversary by the extension of the system to include medical care insurance for our older citizens . A quarter of a century ago , the people of the United States turned their back on the dole and the means test , and chose instead to rely on self-financed insurance , paid through the social security system , to protect themselves against the hazards of old age .	unknown	Now , people disagree with that . Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson believe that the social security route , which would compel all people - whether they wanted health insurance or not - to , in effect , have it through subscribing to social security , is the best one to provide medical care or people over 65 . I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	562	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare . At the London Conference of 1957 , the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties , and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament , we sent a man who had not been active in the field , Harold Stassen , we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position . Mr. Stassen was never able to get clear instructions at the meeting as to what our position was .	unknown	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return . I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise . I know that that kind of firmness is what leads to peace .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	564	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	Not one Republican on the Rules Committee would vote with us . No.2, we went to conference between the House and the Senate on minimum wage . Six out of seven Republicans on that conference voted against that not only the $ 1.25 minimum wage , but also against the President 's own program which we finally offered as a compromise .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	565	We 're not going to because the American people recognize that good times are with us today and that they can be better tomorrow . So , if we 're not going to have a recession , how about our programs for progress for the future ? Well , here , as you might expect , the voter again is confronted with a real problem , because I say that I have programs that will produce progress , better schools and better housing for all Americans , a program of medical care for the aged , a program that will expand job opportunities for all of our people ; a program in the field of civil rights that sees that all Americans move forward together , leaving none behind . My opponent , of course , has programs in these same fields , and , so , here again you have the predicament .	unknown	Can you tell me what , in the last 25 years , what program the Republican leadership ever suggested that served the people ? [ Response from the audience . ] Housing legislation and social security ? Minimum wage ? All of the programs that serve our people , that advance our country , that provide this country with vigor and vitality , education , security for our aged citizens under medical care under social security , all these programs have been initiated by the party which we lead in this campaign . And as you look at the sixties and recognize the need for new resolutions to new problems , I ca n't believe that this country will entrust the leadership to a candidate and a party that have opposed progress in the last 25 years .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	567	Have you ever talked to a Negro mother as I have ? Have you ever heard her tell you , try to explain to a child in the South ? How do you explain that she can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but ca n't sit at the counter and have a Coca - Cola ? This makes you understand that it is n't enough just to pass laws ; it is n't enough just to make speeches , but what you have to do is do what the Attorney General of the United States must do , not just a lot of promises and talk , but get in the leaders of chainstores and get them to agree to break down this barrier so that we can remove this block from the people of this country and our Nation . What about unemployment ? How can you believe me when I say I will move this economy forward , that we will use all the power of this Government to fight unemployment , to fight recession ; but , more than that , we 're going to use it in a positive way to stimulate employment , to open new avenues for expansion of economy ? How do you know ? How can you believe me ? I 'll tell you why . Because I know what it means .	unknown	Fourth , we must move to meet the growing crisis of automation - the replacement of men by machines - which has already thrown thousands of men out of work here in Michigan and which threatens the jobs of millions of men throughout the country . In the past 8 years nothing has been done to harness automation to serve the welfare of all our people , rather than permitting it to become an instrument of economic distress and unemployment . In 1961 , a Democratic President will call a conference of leaders of industry and labor to formulate new programs for dealing with the problems of automation .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	569	And now , if I could spell it out in two or three directions . First , let 's take this problem of medical care for the aged . It 's one that is very close to my heart .	unknown	Minimum wage - Mr. Nixon 's Republican Party voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties , and they voted 90 percent against the $ 1.25 in 1960 . They voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties , and they voted 90 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security in 1960 . This is the party which has stood still , and I do n't believe in 1960 any American can stand still .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	570	The arms control research institute would coordinate and direct all these research efforts , carrying them on itself or farming them out to private firms and universities . The scattered disarmament technicians , scientists , and policymakers could at last work as a unit with a central purpose and direction given by the President himself . Third - we must begin , perhaps within the framework of the arms control research institute , to plan for the reconversion of our economy from war to peace .	unknown	They would use it because their aim is to conquer the world . So , my friends , let me say this : We will work for disarmament , yes . We will work to stop tests and get an agreement , yes ; but we will never agree to anything unless we are sure they are going to keep the bargain because that 's how America has got into trouble in the past , and we are not going to make that mistake in the future .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	571	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	unknown	First , we will repass , and I will sign , the depressed areas bill making available special funds to areas of long-term unemployment . Second , we will pass , and I will sign , a bill raising the minimum wage to $ 1.25 an hour , to make certain that areas with a longer history of industrial development will not be unjustly penalized in their effort to hold on to existing businesses . Third , we will pass , and I will sign , legislation to help cities and towns combat water pollution - to enable these stricken communities to reclaim a resource precious for both industrial use and better living conditions .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	572	Fact : In 1938 , when the first bill was passed , the Republicans voted against it 48 to 31 in the House and 13 to 2 in the Senate . Fact : When the minimum wage was raised from 40 cents to 75 cents an hour , every Republican on the House Labor Committee opposed it and the Republicans in the House voted 143 to 12 to take away minimum wage protection from 1 million workers who were covered . Fact : In 1960 , the attempt to raise the minimum wage to $ 1.25 an hour was defeated in the House when Republicans voted 119 to 27 against it .	unknown	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	573	He did not equivocate , because he was the President of the United States . The Lincoln tradition is not found in a man who considers $ 1.25 minimum wage to be , and I quote him  extreme .  The Lincoln tradition of courage [ applause ] is not found in a man who considers Federal aid for education and teachers salaries to be  extreme ,  and I quote him accurately , and who calls helping our older citizens through the medium of social security to provide medical care for their aged life - who considers that to be  extreme .	unknown	To strengthen our country from within , he promises to move the Federal Government into the very heart of your school system by providing Federal dollars for use to pay the salaries of your teachers , which would inevitably bring Federal control of what is taught . To assure a vital economy , he promises a minimum wage that official studies show would force unemployment and business failures . To protect the unfortunate , he promises to give the wealthiest people in American a helping hand with medical costs in their later years , while withholding help from some 3 million people with incomes of $ 2,000 or less ; in fact , in the name of freedom he would force this medical program on one and all , save the 3 million who need help the most .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	574	[ Applause . ] I divide the issues which face us as a country domestically into two categories : First , I think it is necessary that we finish the job which Wilson and Roosevelt began , the fight for medical care for the aged , for minimum wage of $ 1.25 , for Federal aid to education , for housing , for a better life for all Americans under a system of equality for all Americans , and then I say that there are new problems which Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt , and Harry Truman never heard of in their generation . In my race for the Presidency I traveled in many primaries and in many States , in the deserted textile towns ot New Hampshire , in the deserted farms of Wisconsin , in the deserted coal mines of West Virginia , in the lumber fields of Oregon , where men were out of work , even though we needed housing .	unknown	They talked . But what did they produce ? They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ? Nothing at all .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	575	Secondly , in the case of Cuba , I think the basic error was made in the last stage of Batista , when we did not use our great influence which we had then to persuade Batista to permit free elections and a return to constitutional government , and let the Cuban people pick his successor , instead of letting Castro seize it in almost a palace revolution . Thirdly , I think that in the problem of Cuba we have to work with the other - the Organization of the American States , and I am most concerned , not only that we isolate Cuba , but that we attempt to isolate the Cuban revolution from the rest of South America . I think that is the big danger , that from Cuba as a base they will expand their power .	unknown	We have cooperated with and supported the United Nations . We have not bullied Cuba , in spite of the provocation of its Communist-oriented government . We have dealt with this threat to the peace and stability of the hemisphere as we pledged we would in our solemn treaty commitments .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	576	We say that in the field of education we are proud that we stand for a program that will build more schools , that will raise the levels of our teachers ' salaries , but which rejects the program that they have that would endanger the right of the States to control education and that would , in effect , give to the Federal government the power not only to pay teachers , but to tell them what to teach - and that must never happen in the United States of America . We say that the answer to the problem of health care for our old people is our way and not theirs . Why ? Because ours is a program which leaves to the individual the choice , the choice of what he wants in the way of protection .	unknown	[ Applause . ] If you agree with a policy of no new starts , a policy which does not develop the resources of the Wabash or the Ohio Rivers , if you agree that $ 1.25 minimum wage in a company making more than a million dollars a year is excessive , and , to use Mr. Nixon 's words ,  extreme  ; if you believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security is too extreme , if you believe that these programs which I believe are essential to the maintenance of full employment , if you believe that they are too extreme , then you should vote for Mr. Nixon . If you believe that the area redevelopment bill , which has been vetoed twice , which would mean so much to this community and other communities , which are hard hit by chronic unemployment , and you want it vetoed a third time , you should vote for Mr. Nixon .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	577	if we want jobs , the way is through peace , with peace , and without inflation .

political	578	So , I say to you : America should not take a chance on inexperienced leadership , however well intentioned it is , when you have experienced leadership that know these men and will deal with them effectively in the years ahead . And , now , if I may turn to one final point , and I mention this particularly to this group here , because there are some students here : Necessarily , in a campaign we have to discuss what we term the so-called hard issues in terms of foreign policy , specific issues like Cuba , Quemoy and Matsu , Lebanon , et cetera , and there is a tendency for Americans to forget the really important asset that we have in this great struggle in which we 're engaged . You know what it is ? It is n't our great military strength , and it is n't our great economic strength , and these are both tremendously significant and necessary ; but the strength of America is in what we believe .	unknown	[ Applause . ] But I would also like to hear him discuss not just Cuba , but also the United States , Pennsylvania , how we are going to build a strong society here in the United States . I do n't worry about the cause of freedom , I do n't worry about our prestige around the world , our influence around the globe , as long as we are moving here at home .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	580	But we can always do better and I am determined that we shall do better in quickening the pace of our economic advance and in minimizing interruptions to it . I am determined to undertake every sensible measure to that end , to lift to ever higher levels the number of jobs in America , to reduce unemployment further , and to utilize more fully our industrial capacity in steel and other lines To achieve that goal we must release fully the greatest creative force in human affairs - the spirit of individual enterprise in 180 million Americans . That effort calls for a many-sided program which I have been developing , and will continue to develop , in this campaign .	unknown	A real  truth squad ,  for example , would find it necessary to ask Mr. Nixon such questions as these : 1. Why do you repeat the statement that real wages have gone up 15 percent during the present administration compared with only 2 percent in the previous one , when your own Department of Labor figures clearly establish that the increase between September 1945 ( the first postwar month ) and January 1953 was 18.3 percent while the increase between January 1953 and August 1960 has been 13.7 percent . 2. Why have you not personally admitted that you misquoted me when you said that in my Detroit speech on Labor Day I had said  What the American labor movement wants for America is what I want for America  when this statement did not appear in either my advance statement or in the speech as actually delivered ? 3. When you insist that Federal aid to teachers salaries means Federal control over education , are you aware of the fact that the present program for aid to federally impacted areas has been free of such control , and that the provision which you killed with your tie-breaking vote contained explicit language ruling out any Federal  direction , supervision , or control over the policy determinations , personnel , program of instruction , or the administration or operation of any school or school system  ? 4. How can you claim credit for the present administration for more new water project starts than any other time in our history , when the stated Republican position except in campaign election years has been a no-new-starts policy that the Democratic Congress has sought to overcome ? 5. How can you call the vetoed 1960 Democratic bill on depressed areas  straight pork barrel  when your own Secretary of Labor , just 24 hours before the veto was announced , called the bill  good enough so that any Senator or Congressman from a State with areas of chronic unemployment would have no alternative but vote for it  ? 6. Why do you take credit for the present levels of operations at the National Institutes of Health , when the Democratic Congress , ignoring threats of veto , raised the administration request from $ 400 million to $ 560 million for the present year - the sixth consecutive year that Democrats have raised administration requests ? 7. On October 5 , in Philadelphia , you talked about civil rights and said ,  My position and that of my running mate has been clear and straightforward . We have said the same thing in every section of the country .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	581	I am not talking about prosperity for our largest banks , our largest defense contractors , or our largest investors who have made record profits under the high interest rate procurement and tax policies of this administration . I am talking about prosperity for all the people - for the women in some of our largest stores who are being paid 65 cents an hour - for the retired cutter who can not pay his medical bills on an average social security check of $ 72 a month - for the unemployed fitter who must support his family on an unemployment check averaging less than $ 35 a week - for the Negro accountant who has to take a job as a messenger - for the Puerto Rican lawyer who has to drive a truck - the children who have to grow up in overcrowded slums and go to overcrowded schools - they are not sharing in what Mr. Nixon calls unprecedented prosperity . But to meet their needs effectively , according to Mr. Nixon , would take higher taxes or inflation .	unknown	It is sound . We have seen unemployment move down last month more than seasonally and employment rise more than seasonally . New car sales are moving up .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	583	The point is that we pay for that . Every time the President vetoes a housing bill , every time a Republican Member votes against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , every time we are unable to get any support on our bill to tie medical care for the aged to social security , it is not the Congress that suffers , it is not the administration ; it is the people of the United States who require , in my opinion , a progressive , forward-looking government if this country is going to move forward . It is no accident that 400,000 people in a rich State like Pennsylvania wait every month for surplus food packages from the Federal Government .	unknown	They talked . But what did they produce ? They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ?

political	585	No other task is more important . For remember that the polls will not open next Tuesday , or any other day in any real sense , in Moscow or in Peiping - or in Mr. Castro 's Cuba - or in the so-called satellite nations where I found no satellite peoples . We must vote on behalf of those peoples next Tuesday as well as ourselves - on behalf of all those who want to vote for the cause of freedom but lack the freedom to vote .	unknown	[ Cheers and applause . ] And then , three , we have the lesson in Cuba , here again the President , with great statesmanship , saying he will contain Mr. Castro ; we will contain him economically and politically , Senator Kennedy saying  No '  ; we 've got to go further , and then shooting from the hip , advocating direct Government intervention , in effect , and it was interpreted that way all over the free world , in the affairs of Cuba .

One of the reasons why we have never been able to get an agreement on the disarmament of outer space is because we are second in outer space , and the Soviet Union will not give way their advantage . We arm to parley , and we must be strong if we are going to disarm and maintain our security .	unknown	We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests . Why ? Because they want a closed society and they want no inspection .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	587	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	unknown	We are already racing from the jet age to the space age before meeting the safety , airport development , and other problems of the former .

She 's been moving .	unknown	But the record is written in the Congress , day in and day out . On medical care for the aged tied to social security , which would cost 3 cents a day per person , an average of $ 12 a year it would insure any person retiring that they would receive medical care , nursing care , the cost of their medicine . Now , under the bill which the President signed , if you get sick and you are retired , and you have saved up $ 500 or $ 800 , you have to first exhaust all of that for medical bills , then you take a pauper 's oath that you are medically indigent .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	592	Mr. Nixon himself was in Latin America 5 years ago and here is what he said :  If we had produced economic progress in Cuba we might have averted the Cuban takeover .  Why did n't we ? That is what he said a month ago ; why did n't we in 1955 come forward with a program that would have prevented Castro from taking power ? When he was there in 1955 , he said , and you can judge his experience ,  I am convinced that communism has passed its highwater mark in Latin America ,  at a time when the Communists were about to communize Cuba . Our third failure has been our inability to establish contact with the young people of that area that will run the country .	unknown	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply . And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	593	That 's what the program will buy for you . A compulsory medical care program - and I will have more to say about that in a moment . A teachers ' program , an education program , which differs from ours in this fundamental : It would take our teachers and put them directly under the Federal Government as far as subsidization of their salaries is concerned , and the net result of that would give the inevitable power to the Federal Government to tell our teachers what to teach - and we do n't want that in Washington .	unknown	, or Boston , Mass .

Thus it is clear that you and I are diametrically opposed on a matter of great public interest and one which the next President may have to deal with as soon as he assumes the office .	unknown	[ Applause . ] I have asked Mr. Nixon to participate in a fifth debate which I think should cover the question of Cuba and other important problems facing the American people .

This makes you understand that it is n't enough just to pass laws ; it is n't enough just to make speeches , but what you have to do is do what the Attorney General of the United States must do , not just a lot of promises and talk , but get in the leaders of chainstores and get them to agree to break down this barrier so that we can remove this block from the people of this country and our Nation . What about unemployment ? How can you believe me when I say I will move this economy forward , that we will use all the power of this Government to fight unemployment , to fight recession ; but , more than that , we 're going to use it in a positive way to stimulate employment , to open new avenues for expansion of economy ?

Concern was expressed at that time about changing our immigration laws to allow more refugees to come in , concern with regard to the effect on employment and unemployment in this country , concern as to how these people could be assimilated .

In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	unknown	And this administration says , when we try to provide aid to education , when we try to provide medical care for the aged , it is too extreme . When we try to pass $ 1.25 minimum wage , per hour , $ 50 a week [ applause ] $ 50 a week , Mr. Nixon says it is extreme . Mr. Nixon represents the same party that in the midthirties voted 90 percent against social security , 90 percent against the minimum wage of 25 cents an hour , and in 1960 voted 90 percent against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , and medical care for the aged tied to social security .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	603	They are different from the ones he advocates . The fact that they are different , however , does n't give him the right to say , as he did when he was in Minnesota , that I and my party are against medical care for the aged , that we are against better schools , that we are against better housing , that we are against better conditions of employment for our people . All that I can say is that when he says that he is simply talking in terms of the promises he makes , and if he had produced anything in his promises , he might have a right to talk , but he has n't done a thing yet and he has nothing to recommend him to elect him President of the United States on the basis of the special session .	unknown	And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system .

political	604	I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	unknown	He prepared a report .

political	605	Let me say , briefly , I believe there are two points . First , those of you who are active in labor , those of you who lead organized labor movements , are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public , and you know very well , perhaps better than anyone , that this country still has unfinished business , that we have to maintain full employment , that we have to advance the standards of living of our people , of better housing , of better minimum wage , of medical care for the aged . Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished .	unknown	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	608	Every piece of important legislation of benefit to our people was opposed by the Republicans when they first came into being , away back to the Federal Reserve Board , all the reforms of the Roosevelt administration , social security , all the others , minimum wage , housing , benefits to the farmers , all opposed . Now , with that long history , TVA , the development of our resources , all in opposition , with that long history , how can we expect that that party and that candidate can move this country ahead , with all the changes coming on , the prospects for unemployment , the recession possibly this winter in 1961 , with our farm income down 25 percent , with 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never seeing the inside of a college , who graduate from high school , our prestige in the world being affected , with Communists on the march , Castro on the march . I believe the United States has to make a decision .	unknown	What we have done in the Eisenhower administration is that we have developed policies that have brought high employment but without war , and I can assure you that we are going to do everything we can to expand the economy , to continue to see that those Americans who want to work will be able to get work . My last point is this : Look at the unemployment figures . They are going down every month .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	609	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	unknown	From now until November 8 we are taking our ease to the forum in which it belongs , where there is no threat of veto , where there is no parliamentary obstruction , and where we will be successful - and that is the forum of the American people . Until a Democrat is in the White house , the Republicans can block action on an adequate minimum wage , they can water down medical care for the aged , they can play politics with civil rights , they can block action on a decent housing bill and a good school bill . But they can not block the American people on November 8. The theme of this campaign is going to be action - action at home to keep pace with our growing needs , to help the unfortunate , to build a still greater nation - and action abroad , to match the rise in Communist power , to meet the turbulent revolutions reshaping our globe .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	610	But that means $ 3,000 more he pays for that house before he pays off his mortgage , and that is one reason why housing starts are off 20 percent this year , even though our population is increasing by 3 million a year . That is why there is unemployment in lumberyards and that is why some of our mills in Oregon are closing down . In 1952 , a typical school district wanting to build a million-dollar school faced interest on their bonds of $ 328,000 .	unknown	Listening to the opposition , one would never know that there are almost 68 million Americans at work in our $ 500 billion economy and that Americans are earning at a record annual rate of over $ 408 billion .

political	612	We 'll see that we move ahead in science . We will see to it that we have social security and unemployment insurance , that we will extend all of these things that are good for America and that Americans need , but I say to you also , as President , that there will be certainly not one dollar spent that does n't need to be spent . And here you 've got a choice .	unknown	I was the floor manager and as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor brought the first area redevelopment bill to the floor of the Senate .

political	613	And I do n't blame Mr. Nixon for trying to forget the record of a party which has opposed virtually every single Democratic measure designed to improve human welfare in this century , a party which has not initiated a single piece of forward looking social legislation since the time of William Howard Taft . Mr. Nixon did not ignore party affiliations between elections , when he led the Republican opposition to increased minimum wages , medical care for the aged , aid to education , help for distressed areas , and all the rest and the American people are not going to ignore Mr. Nixon 's party affiliation next week . The third Nixon theme is an attack on the policies of the Democratic Party .	unknown	Vocational training and other educational programs are prime cases in point , where we can buy invaluable lead-time against the problems of the aged by starting with persons of middle age . One of the most important preventives of all would be to accelerate the use of private medical care insurance programs which would enable people of working age to take adequate action to safeguard their health . I think we should give immediate consideration to allowing tax deductions for the cost of health insurance , designed to protect them against catastrophic illnesses that place crippling burdens on our families .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	614	The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands . But , like the seafaring man on the desert of waters , you choose them as your guides , and following them you will reach your destiny .	unknown	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war .

political	615	The arms control research institute would coordinate and direct all these research efforts , carrying them on itself or farming them out to private firms and universities . The scattered disarmament technicians , scientists , and policymakers could at last work as a unit with a central purpose and direction given by the President himself . Third - we must begin , perhaps within the framework of the arms control research institute , to plan for the reconversion of our economy from war to peace .	unknown	Halt the arms race .  Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	618	[ Applause . ] And the reason that we insist that disarmament must not be just a fine slogan but that it must be honest and that there must be an agreement which will see that both sides keep it is not because we do not want disarmament but because we do want disarmament . We want the fact of disarmament rather than the fiction of it which is what the Soviets up to this time have been offering , since they have not offered inspection along with it .	unknown	Secondly , peace requires an America that is planning , preparing , and striving for disarmament and other steps toward peace . Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations . A successful blueprint for a safe disarmament is as difficult to devise as a successful blueprint for modern war .	unknown	support	disarmament

There have been a series of opportunities , conferences , and proposals by other nations including the Russians .	unknown	We must take advantage of these new technological discoveries , and we must move forward also because the Soviet is moving forward , and we must never let this gap , which presently exists between their strength and ours , a gap in our favor , be narrowed . As a matter of fact , we must increase it , increase it until the time comes when we can have real disarmament with inspection - and more about that later . In addition to this , of course , we need intelligence activities , and I want to talk very frankly about intelligence tonight , because this is a matter that has been discussed during this campaign , as you will recall , in our debates .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	621	I do n't think the monetary and fiscal policies which this administration has followed are good enough . I believe that when they stand against the minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , I think they are standing in the way of progress . We have high interest rates and as a partial result we built this year 200,000 less homes than we needed in this country to stay up with our population .	unknown	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .

I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .	unknown	It is no wonder that in the 1920 's the recession and depression of 1929 was preceded by the sharpest decline in agricultural income that the country had seen up to that date . And now here in Indiana , and in this city of Terre Haute , you have unemployment of nearly 7 percent , you see steel mills in Gary and elsewhere in this State which are working 55 or 60 percent of capacity , and every merchant and every banker in the State of Indiana can tell you that this September and this October have been as difficult and hard as the September and October of 1957 , and the September and October at the end of 1953 , which preceded the recessions of 1954 and 1958 .

political	626	Perhaps the science of inspection will be unable to keep pace with advancing weapons technology . But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament .	unknown	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war .

Senator Clark fought for the second bill , I was the floor manager for the first bill , the distressed area bill , the area redevelopment bill , and twice this administration vetoed that bill , which would have helped this county and would have helped Sharon .	unknown	In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million .

What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing .

Between November 1957 and August 1960 the rate of jobless workers , seasonally adjusted , has been below 5 percent of the labor force in only 3 months out of 34 .	unknown	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1.

Second , it will extend the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act to 5 million additional employees , chiefly in large-scale interstate retail and service industries , thereby guaranteeing these employees a fair minimum wage and a just premium for overtime .	unknown	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	632	I think you could get a resolution through in the forthcoming General Assembly that would accomplish a lot . Q. Mr. Ambassador , have you had time to catch up today on the Russian proposal for a kind of summit meeting in the General Assembly on disarmament ? A. Yes . I heard about it .	unknown	Mr. Nixon may now say he has been urging an acceleration of our defense all along - but in his August 10 press conference the President said he knew of no such different viewpoint by the Vice President , adding :  Certainly if there is , he has n't come to me about it .  What was the Security Council doing while the Nation was undergoing this experience ? Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina , Hungary , Suez , Sputnik , the riots in Venezuela , the collapse of the summit , the riots in Japan , the collapse of the Baghdad Pact , the failure of disarmament , the U-2 fiasco , and now Cuba and the Congo ? Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report , the Killian report , and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance : for  Atoms for Peace  was a slogan , the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce , the  open skies  plan was a gesture , and the Baghdad Pact was a failure . Mr. Nixon has presided , in short , over the decline of our national security .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	634	And , worse still , it would have meant surrender at the conference table . And then the third instance , the instance of Cuba - here again shooting from the hip , but not in the Texas fashion , because he missed the mark completely [ cheers and applause ] shooting from the hip and , rather than following the President , who said we 'll handle this fellow , Castro , within our treaties by quarantining him economically and politically , he said : No; no. We 've got to go further than that . We 've got to break our treaties - and he did n't say that but that 's the way everything was interpreted .	unknown	Fifth , I have tried in this campaign to address myself to the real issues confronting America - the real issue is world freedom or world slavery . World peace or world war , stopping the Communist advance which in 8 years has penetrated deep into Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America - taking over Cuba itself - without firing a single shot or losing a single soldier . That is the real issue - peace - and my greatest objective is peace because I know something of war .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	636	Now , before we go into this question , many people will say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , are you for Castro ? Do n't you think we ought to support the people that are against him ?  The question is not whether you 're for or against Castro . The question is : What do you do ? What can you properly do ? What can the great United States of America legally and properly do to help the people of Cuba get the kind of government they deserve ? And this is n't easy . It is n't the easy shooting-from-the-hip way that Senator Kennedy has suggested .	unknown	But what I do suggest is that at least we have some concern , some recognition , some idea of the changing nature of our times . The whole problem in Cuba is not a dialogue about Mr. Castro . The whole problem in Cuba is what is going to happen in the rest of Latin America , whose side is going to be successful in those areas , which system offers the hope to these people .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	637	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	Third , we must work to establish decent , adequate and fair national standards of unemployment compensation and minimum wages . The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration . Our unemployment benefits , too , must be standardized and extended .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	unknown	We were not as successful as I hoped we would be . But I think the real difficulty is the fact that on the two bills which were most controversial , the $ 1.25 minimum wage , and the aid to the aged and social security , we were informed in both cases that if those bills passed , the President would veto them . All the President has to do to stop action is to veto any bill and he needs , according to the Constitution , only one-third plus one of either body to sustain his veto .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	640	[ Applause . ] I have asked Mr. Nixon to participate in a fifth debate which I think should cover the question of Cuba and other important problems facing the American people . I still find it impossible to understand why Mr. Nixon wants to limit the debate to one subject where there are so many important problems facing the American people .	unknown	It is true , as you stated in your telegram , that I said that I intended to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . When I said that I had no idea that you would make even a greater blunder about Cuba . Consequently , I will talk about not only Quemoy and Matsu but also about Cuba every day during the next 2 weeks - I will do this because I am deeply concerned about the policies you advocate in those two areas of the world which might well lead to abandoning free territory in the Far East , and a loss of all of our Latin American allies in this hemisphere or worse .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	641	They do n't care , and I 'll prove it . We have a bill which does it the American way , not one that would have compulsory health insurance that would reduce the standard of medical care , that would compel millions of people who do n't want it and did n't need it to have it , but , one , a bill in which every American over 65 who wanted health insurance can get it , either private or Government , but in which no one in this country is compelled to have it against his will . That 's the American way of handling this problem .	unknown	And this is all going to come at a time when automation and machinery is taking the place of men and women . I believe that we have to educate our children , that we have to provide jobs for those who want to work , that we have to provide security for those who have retired , particularly for medical care , that we must build in this country a strong and vital society which serves as an inspiration and an example to all those who look to us with confidence and hope . I come to this community in the closing days of a long campaign .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	642	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	unknown	[ Laughter . ] He voted as a Congressman in 1949 to take 1 million people out from under the coverage of the Minimum Wage Act . Mr. Nixon and the Republicans have stood against the progress since time began , and I believe in 1960 , in Michigan , which knows the significance of this election , I believe in Michigan and the United States , they are not going to entrust leadership to a candidate and a party that looks to the past .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	643	And I say to you , my friends , that whatever the good intentions are , however many mistakes have been made and corrected by my opponent in this campaign , that in this critical period we can not afford to use the White House as a training school to give a man experience at the expense of the American people . There is your choice , the choice at home of going forward or back , of building on the great progress that we have made - building toward better schools , better hospitals , better medical care for our older people - of providing all the good things of life , but doing it through allowing Americans to do everything they can for themselves and Government doing everything that people will not do for themselves ; and in the foreign field , a choice between experience and known qualities , and inexperience and the chance that a mistake , out of the best of intentions , could set off the disaster that we do not want . My friends , I think you know what the answer is .	unknown	[ Applause . ] Any party which opposed , when it began , social security , 90 percent , who voted 95 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage of the midthirties , who voted 90 percent in the House of Representatives against $ l.25 an hour in 1960 , any party which has opposed housing legislation , medical care for our aged tied to social security , any party which goes to the people in 1960 , saying we never had it so good , that our prestige has never been higher - I do n't believe that they are the party or the candidates to lead this country in the dangerous sixties .

political	644	The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands . But , like the seafaring man on the desert of waters , you choose them as your guides , and following them you will reach your destiny .	unknown	We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests . Why ? Because they want a closed society and they want no inspection .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	645	Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring . The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands .	unknown	Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done . We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	646	As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace . We would be limiting our power at a time that the only one that threatens the peace of the world would be maintaining an advantage and gaining one that he did not previously have .	unknown	I would put more people into it . I would indicate our desire not only to maintain our strength , but also to provide for orderly disarmament . Thirdly , I would hope that the United States could make for effective judgments of the events that are going to occur .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	648	They are still making those charges today . But can anyone here really imagine an America without the New Deal ? Can anyone imagine this Nation without social security , without unemployment compensation and old-age assistance , without minimum wages and maximum working hours , without Federal guarantees of collective bargaining , without regulation of security issues and stock exchanges , without the guarantee of bank deposits , without protection for our farmers ? There were many conferences on all these programs held here at Warm Springs . President Roosevelt used to talk about the  spirit of Warm Springs * * * the general feeling that we are all part of a family .	unknown	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	649	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	unknown	We only need a few more . A shift of only four votes would have given us a decent bill to provide medical care for the aged under the social security system . And next January we will have those votes .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	651	I want to ask them three questions . They talk about prosperity : No.1, Mr. Nixon says $ 1.25 a hour minimum wage is extreme . Ninety percent of the Republicans voted against it .	unknown	The principles for which Dwight Eisenhower and I have fought and will continue to fight are the ideals not only of Republicans but of Democrats as well . All through the campaign my opponent has been trumpeting the falsehood that I , in effect , feast on human misery - that I oppose minimum wage , help to distressed areas , social security , medical care for the aged , and all else that concerns the good of the American people . Last week Mr. Kennedy called me the leader of the social security wrecking crew - trying to secure votes from the aged by playing on their fears .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	653	That problem , for America , has been solved . What have not been solved are those problems which lie largely in the realm of public action - bad housing , poverty , recessions , unemployment , discrimination , crowded and obsolete schools and hospitals and libraries , inadequate recreation , the breakdown of mass transportation , polluted air and water , juvenile delinquency . These problems are compounded as we become more and more an urban nation .	unknown	But both of them lived many , many years longer , and both of them , the longer they lived , gained love and affection from the American people - and I would only hope tonight that , however this election turns out , Senator Kennedy and I in the years ahead will be able to conduct ourselves with the dignity , the decency which earned the esteem and the love of the American people for the two men who were engaged in that great campaign of 1928 . The decline in unemployment throughout the country reported last week by the Departments of Labor and Commerce is good news for America . It must have come as a disappointing surprise to the opposition camp from which we are hearing so much foreboding talk about the future these days .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	654	And what has the United States been doing in the same 12 months ? We have frustrated congressional attempts to build more missiles , to harden our missile bases , to increase our powerful submarine fleet . We have failed to propose a consistent , comprehensive and workable plan for disarmament that would gain the support , at least , of the free world , based on careful preparation and technical studies . And we have been repeatedly reassured by Mr. Nixon - in glowing , sugar-coated terms that we have nothing to worry about in arms , science and space - that we have achieved peace without surrender - that statistics which show that the Russian economy is expanding faster than ours are dismissed as  growthmanship  - and that anti-American riots in Latin America and Japan were actually indications that the Communists were afraid to face us .	unknown	We can be proud that we are working through the United Nations to maintain the freedom of these people rather than to take it away . It 's true that President Eisenhower is n't making a fool of himself on the floor of the U.N. It 's true that he is advocating a program for disarmament , for the use of outer space , a program in addition , for the use of our surpluses through the United Nations . All of these are honest , decent proposals , which the whole world applauds .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	656	These are programs for which I stand . Also , we believe in programs which would deal with the problems of unemployment more effectively . Programs which will deal with the problems of the depressed areas .	unknown	They are not the goals of his party , and Mr. Nixon and his party have opposed and killed every one of these programs . And their opposition - an opposition born of indifference to the urgent needs of the American people - has helped transform the Duluth - Superior area into a section of declining income , and increasing unemployment . But northern Minnesota has not been the only area to suffer .	unknown	attack	unemployment

Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force .	unknown	Put your thumb down regardless of what you do . We are fighting a candidate , the Republican Party , that for 20 years has opposed what the people need , minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation .

political	658	Only 90 miles away stood the United States - their good neighbor - the richest Nation on earth - its radios and newspapers and movies spreading the story of America 's material wealth and surplus crops . But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba , nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance - assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship - assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people - assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life . This year Mr. Nixon admitted that if we had formulated a program of Latin American economic development 5 years ago :  It might have produced economic progress in Cuba which might have averted the Castro takeover .	unknown	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today . Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

political	660	Thomas Jefferson has often made the point that the greatest guarantee of freedom is to diffuse power and that we must not have concentration of power in an all-powerful Federal Government , and it is because we believe that any kind of program that would put immense power in the Federal Government over our school system is something that Americans should reject , not because of the amount of money that is being spent , but because this kind of power is something which , in the wrong hands , would be something that all Americans would be against . Let me give you one other example in the program of medical care for the aged . We all want better health care for our older citizens .	unknown	[ Applause . ] If you agree with a policy of no new starts , a policy which does not develop the resources of the Wabash or the Ohio Rivers , if you agree that $ 1.25 minimum wage in a company making more than a million dollars a year is excessive , and , to use Mr. Nixon 's words ,  extreme  ; if you believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security is too extreme , if you believe that these programs which I believe are essential to the maintenance of full employment , if you believe that they are too extreme , then you should vote for Mr. Nixon .

political	662	We must plan for the orderly reallocation of these resources to our peacetime needs . I do not share the opinion of some that disarmament would bring economic disaster . I believe that America can fruitfully use all our present productive power and much more to meet our vital needs for schools and roads and power and all the rest as well as our commitments to the war against poverty and Communist subversion abroad .	unknown	We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace . We do n't want anything from anybody else , but remember this : The moment the men in the Kremlin ever have more strength than we have , the moment we ever enter into a disarmament agreement , which would not have ironclad inspection , in which they would gain strength against us , we find that the enemies of peace then , the men in the Kremlin , are in a position where they can do what they want , and that is : They would use their strength to start war .

Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth .	unknown	One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally .

You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	unknown	Previous to the convention we had passed housing , aid to education .

political	666	If we ever have disarmament in this world , disarmament without inspection , in which the strength of the Soviet Union relative to that of the United States is increased , the risk of war increases . In other words , disarmament without inspection increases the risk of war . It 's only disarmament with inspection that will reduce the risk of war .	unknown	Such an effort requires not only long-term development loans but education , student exchanges , stepped up Voice of America broadcasts , concerned and competent Ambassadors , and a wide range of measures designed to increase the strength of freedom and stimulate the economic advance on which freedom often depends .

You have to make your judgment .	unknown	We 're going to have to have more in the field of education . We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ?

Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign .	unknown	Thus far these fighters for freedom have had virtually no support from our Government .  This clearly means , as the New York Times Washington correspondent , James Reston , reported in today 's paper :  His statement this week on Cuba , publicly calling for Government aid to overthrow Castro , is a clear violation of the inter-American treaty prohibition against intervention in the internal affairs of the hemisphere Republics .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ?

Now what can be done ? Here 's my answer : I say that in this field we want first to be sure that we maintain what we have today , and you know what it is ? The best medical care in the world . We do n't want to do anything that reduces the standard of our medical care .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	675	And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction . But we will not move toward disarmament and a secure peace , we will not be any closer to freedom from fear , if we simply follow Mr. Nixon 's plan for meetings , more conferences , more study groups and discussions .	unknown	The hope for peace is to be firm against those who threaten the peace so that they ca n't blackmail us . The hope for peace is then to go out and sit down , from a position of strength , and negotiate for disarmament for peace but always from strength and never from weakness . And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	679	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	unknown	I believe the American people prefer their experience under the Democratic Party . Our experience is written in the Social Security Act , the minimum wage laws , the FHA , the REA , guaranteed bank deposits , TVA and a host of other programs . The Bible tells us that  whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	681	It 's been done , incidentally , over the objection of some well-intentioned , but hopelessly naive Castro apologists within the United States - and all that I can say with regard to Senator Kennedy 's position is that he apparently is attempting to obscure his association with the views of this pro-Castro group as indicated in the book that I mentioned a moment ago or he must have thought now that there would be political advantage in taking a stronger position than I have taken , a radical position , instead of the strong and sound position that the administration has taken . And , so , what does he suggest ? He comes up , as I pointed up , with the fantastic recommendation that the U.S. Government shall directly aid the anti-Castro forces both in and out of Cuba . Now , every freedom-loving person in the United States - let 's make it clear - is in sympathy with the democratic anti-Castro forces in Cuba and outside Cuba .	unknown	Secondly , how is it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union and France and Britain to come to a conclusion to cease nuclear testing with some worthwhile inspection system ? How is it possible for us , who initiated the first atomic advance - how is it possible for us to make a decisive breakthrough in this area ? Because of experiments now going on in Western Germany , it appears likely that almost 20 countries will have an atomic capacity by 1965 . China , Egypt , Cuba - all the rest of them , all possessing atomic weapons , all possessing a hydrogen capacity perhaps all possessing ballistic missiles , and the means of delivering them . When we realize that war has been the constant companion of mankind through the ages , we are about to move into a period of history when any country or combination of countries can destroy themselves , their adversaries , and perhaps the human race , all in the next 10 years .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	682	Yet in the past 8 years , and in my opinion this is one of the most serious indictments that can be leveled against this administration , in this vital area in the past 8 years this administration has given this problem no attention . In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 people working on the complex subject of arms control and disarmament , less than 100 people , scattered through four or five agencies of the Government . When I reminded Mr. Nixon of this in one of the debates he gave one of his usual answers .	unknown	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing . My friends , that 's a pretty good score in football .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	683	And by that time our chief negotiator had been repudiated by the administration , and publicly demoted from the White House staff . At the next important disarmament conference , the 1958 Geneva Conference on surprise attack , we were represented by a businessman who had been out of Government for 5 years , and who had assumed his duties only 5 weeks before the conference met . Almost up to the opening day of the meeting , we had prepared no position , conducted no special research , formulated no realistic or constructive proposals .	unknown	And I say that we can not and should not blame ourselves , our policies , our negotiators , their scientific advisers , or their instructions , for the unyielding refusal of the Soviets to make an agreement at Geneva . The time and patience which we have already expended to explore this way out of the disarmament dilemma have been full proof of our own intentions and those of the Soviets . The blame rests squarely on them .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	684	There are a billion more people crowding our globe , and every American can hear the rumbling of a distant drum . The next President will have a budget 25 times as large as that of the candidates in Al Smith 's time , and he will face problems unprecedented in that time or in any time in our long history , automation and unemployment , farm surpluses and food shortages , a high cost of living in the midst of an economic slump , new nations , new leaders , the world is different across the street and on the other side of the moon . The white race is in the minority , the free-enterprise system is in the minority , and the majority are looking at us harder and longer than they ever looked before .	unknown	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	685	And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .	unknown	Consider their whole 20-year record . For 6 years in the 1930 's the opposition failed miserably to solve the problem of unemployment . In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	686	And then came a third test , and this a very difficult one . Here we had a little  pipsqueak  dictator , Castro , down in Cuba . The question is not who is against Castro .	unknown	[ Applause . ] But I would also like to hear him discuss not just Cuba , but also the United States , Pennsylvania , how we are going to build a strong society here in the United States . I do n't worry about the cause of freedom , I do n't worry about our prestige around the world , our influence around the globe , as long as we are moving here at home .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	687	But because the magnitude of this problem is increasing , it has reached a point where Government help is needed - and needed badly . In the last session of Congress we Democrats tried to enact a bill to provide for decent medical care for our older citizens under social security . It was a moderate bill .	unknown	Now , a lot of people , l know , could well raise the question as to whether there are other things that are more important as far as this election campaign is concerned than programs that will keep the peace and extend freedom and keep freedom in this country . And I certainly would reply by saying that other things also are very important : We want better schools in America ; we want better health care in America available to all of our citizens ; we want better jobs for our people ; we also want to see the income of our farm families participate in the tremendously increasing prosperity which Americans are enjoying . But , above all , my friends , we want to see these young people , these schoolchildren who by the thousands we have seen along the streets of these Iowa towns and cities today , and who are here by the thousands , we want to see that they grow up to enjoy all these other good things - that they do have a life of peace for themselves and for the world .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	689	For example , while in August of 1958 we sent $ 42 million worth of goods to Cuba - this August we sent only $ 18 million worth as a result of Castro 's deliberate policy of cutting American exports . And , as the New York Times points out this morning , the goods which are now cut off , are the very goods whose export has been declining - while the goods which Cuba can still buy - such as foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals - are the goods whose export has declined relatively little . In addition , the State Department admits that Castro has refused to pay for about one-quarter of the American goods he has received since coming into power .	unknown	As a matter of fact , this talk about the fact that Cuba is lost and that Ghana is lost , and Guinea is lost , incidentally - and they have also claimed that - is irresponsible in the extreme . Cuba is not lost . The fact that Castro , of course , is following a pro-Communist line at the present time causes us great concern , but there are plenty of things that we can do and are doing , and we 're taking some very firm steps , as you know , to quarantine Castro in that area .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	691	They feel we were correct , I think , the majority of them , in acting as we did with regard to the sugar , the taking away of special consideration that we had with regard to sugar . They thought that was justified in view of the Cuban Government 's expropriation of much of our property , but I think our present course in Cuba has not lost us friends in Latin America . If anything , it has gained us friends .	unknown	That is the great force working for us . The seed it planted and ultimately is going to reap the harvest the desire of people to be independent whether they live in Congo or Cuba or Russia or Poland or East Germany . Sooner or later the basic desire to run their own affairs , to be free men and women , I think represents the most powerful force that this country has .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

A good many of our membership are very much concerned about the growth of unemployment throughout this State and throughout the Nation . I wonder if you might in a few words explain what your program will be when you become the President of the United States concerning this problem .	unknown	These are programs for which I stand . Also , we believe in programs which would deal with the problems of unemployment more effectively . Programs which will deal with the problems of the depressed areas .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	695	[ Applause . ] And I could not leave here today , this great source of national strength here in Warm Springs , without reminding all of us that there is still unfinished business before us in the health field , that there are still over 18 million Americans over the age of 65 who live out their lives without assistance , without a recognition of the great problems that they face in the field of health , and I believe it incumbent upon the next Congress and the next administration to permit them to participate in the development of a trust fund which will provide protection in their old age without their having to take , as they now take , a pauper 's oath before they can receive medical assistance and medical care . [ Applause .	unknown	 What are the folks going to do ? What are the voters going to do ? Here 's what you do : First , you look at our record and on the record I say you compare the record of the Eisenhower administration with the record of the administration which preceded it . Both have been in for 7 ½ years , and you can take any test you want - schools , housing , medical care , jobs , wages , controlling inflation - and you will find that in this administration we have moved forward ; we have had far greater progress than in the Truman administration . And , so , your choice is : If you want to go back to what we left , you have an easy choice because that 's what our opponents offer .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	696	He charged that we Republicans were indifferent , indifferent to the problems of unemployment and distress in West Virginia . Now , first , about indifference : I know what unemployment is . I have seen people come into my Dad 's store when they were unemployed and wanted a job and have to put things on the books , and I know the shame in their faces , and I know how difficult it was for the children who were in school with whom I went .	unknown	One in particular is with regard to unemployment compensation . I think that unemployment compensation - our unemployment compensation principles and programs - should be revised , so that we can have a more effective method . That means longer periods which the unemployment compensation covers and also standards which are more general throughout the States , so that you can have a greater cushion during a recession than we presently have .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

Yet in those same 8 years Cuba has been lost to the Communists . Laos has begun to slip behind the Iron Curtain .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

On medical care for the aged tied to social security , which would cost 3 cents a day per person , an average of $ 12 a year it would insure any person retiring that they would receive medical care , nursing care , the cost of their medicine . Now , under the bill which the President signed , if you get sick and you are retired , and you have saved up $ 500 or $ 800 , you have to first exhaust all of that for medical bills , then you take a pauper 's oath that you are medically indigent .	unknown	We have 16 million Americans over the age of 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $ 78 a month . How are they going to get by and find homes , shelter , and medical care ? These are the problems that the United States must face .

Thirdly , I think that we should assist those countries to the south of us who are attempting to solve their staggering economic problems and help them join with us .	unknown	Well , let me say that in the first place I think his purpose in coming here could be manifold .

political	701	[ Laughter . ] But this administration , the same administration that voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties , voted 95 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security . If there is anyone here who has a mother or father who is over 65 , if they get sick and they are living with you , do you know before they can get medical assistance under the program signed by the President , you have to prove that they are medically indigent ? They have to sign an oath , a pauper 's oath , that they have n't any money , nor you , and then they can get assistance .	unknown	We are going to have to provide better schools for our children because we need the best educated children in the world . We are going to have to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security , because all the people are entitled to live out their lives in some kind of dignity , and we are going to have to provide equality of opportunity for all Americans . Now , you have to decide which party and which candidate based on their history , based on their statements in this campaign , based on their look into the future , can lead this country into the dangerous years of the 1960 's , which party and which candidate and which viewpoint can build in this country a strong society which will serve as an inspiration to the people around the world .	unknown	support	medical care,health care

The elimination of unfair competition based upon substandard wages will protect fairminded employers anxious to maintain fair labor standards .	unknown	Social security - they voted against it . Minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation , and in the last session of the Congress in August , when we brought up a bill for medical care for the aged , we received 45 Democrats and 1 Republican who supported it , and we were told it would be vetoed if it passed .

Mr. Nixon has n't mentioned Cuba very prominently in this campaign .	unknown	In the last 8 years we gave 5 percent of all of our economic aid to Latin America , 95 percent to the rest of the world , and we wonder why Castro spreads the doctrine of communism and revolt throughout all of Latin America . Mr. Nixon himself was in Latin America 5 years ago and here is what he said :  If we had produced economic progress in Cuba we might have averted the Cuban takeover .  Why did n't we ? That is what he said a month ago ; why did n't we in 1955 come forward with a program that would have prevented Castro from taking power ? When he was there in 1955 , he said , and you can judge his experience ,  I am convinced that communism has passed its highwater mark in Latin America ,  at a time when the Communists were about to communize Cuba .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	708	I want to explain that in terms of examples today because it seems to me there has been a great lack of understanding in recent months , and , for that matter in recent years , as to why the United States has followed the line that it has diplomatically . People have often spoken to me and they have said ,  Why ca n't we be more flexible in our dealings on disarmament ? Why ca n't we find a bold new program in this area which will make it possible for the Soviet Union to agree ?  And the answer is , of course , that the United States has gone the extra mile in disarmament time and time again . The answer is that the reason the Soviet Union has not agreed is that they do not want apparently to disarm unless we give up the right to inspection .	unknown	We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	unknown	support	disarmament

The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people .

We stand for a program which recognizes this program , recognizes it because we know that all of our families in this country want to see to it that our older citizens not only are well cared for , but that they have the opportunity to get care particularly when illnesses of serious nature strike .	unknown	He promises a farm program that would force drastic cutbacks in production and marketing , force 2 million people out of work , trigger off inflation , sharply raise food prices , create food scarcity , and regiment all agriculture by setting up all sorts of new regulations and creating new battalions of Government overseers to watch over and tell every farmer what he could or could not do . He promises to impose a mandatory medical care plan for the aged on every one of the millions of citizens covered by social security , no matter what their personal desires , and leave 3 million Americans with no medical care program at all .

For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands .

So I come here to Pennsylvania a State which has not gone Democratic in a presidential election for 20 years , and I come here and ask your belp in this campaign .	unknown	In 1935 , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against social security .

Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well .	unknown	As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace .

My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America , our needs in Africa , our needs in Asia , our needs in disarmament , our needs in arms , because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality , curiosity , foresight , and vigor .

I think these issues are important , not because the minimum wage is maybe the most important issue in the United States today , and not because medical care for the aged itself may be the most important issue , and not because aid to education itself may be the most important issue .

And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

It is n't as spectacular as President Eisenhower has done to go before the U.N. and to lay it on the line for controlled disarmament - not phony disarmament - not where you simply have empty pledges , but a case where both sides will disarm .

But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people .	unknown	support	unemployment

I have confidence in an America able to afford the best schools and the best teachers in the world - an America where no one is denied his full constitutional rights by reason of his race or religion - an America where every family lives in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - an America where the cost of living is not completely beyond those who work for a living - particularly those receiving an inadequate minimum wage of $ 1 an hour .

Why are n't we meeting the Communist challenge - from Cuba to the Congo , from India to Indonesia ? Four years ago the cold war was being carried on thousands of miles away . This year it spread to within 90 miles of Florida to Cuba .	unknown	And only a stronger America can hope to maintain its freedom and the freedom of the world . We are faced with an enemy which now commands a vast empire from the Formosa Straits to Berlin - an enemy whose agents of subversion are penetrating into Africa , into Asia , and now stand only 90 miles from our shores in Cuba - an enemy which is convinced of its ultimate victory - which believes , to quote Mr. Khrushchev ,  that the old and the rotten will always fight with the newly emerged , but it is a law of history that the new will always win .

Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	unknown	support	disarmament

political	770	[ Response from the audience ; applause . ] The fact of the matter is that in the last 8 years not a single Soviet soldier has crossed the frontiers of Russia or their present territory , and yet Cuba , Laos , in part Iraq , their influence in Ghana and Guinea , their influence in Latin America their influence in Africa , their influence in Asia , their influence at the United Nations , their military position , their scientific position , their production of scientists and engineers have all steadily increased in relation to ours , and the judgment that you must make as you sit here in Florida , 90 miles from Cuba , 8 minutes by jet - you have to determine whether you can support the leadership of a candidate and a party which runs on a slogan of  We 've Never Had It So Good .  I do n't run on that slogan .	unknown	For example , while in August of 1958 we sent $ 42 million worth of goods to Cuba - this August we sent only $ 18 million worth as a result of Castro 's deliberate policy of cutting American exports . And , as the New York Times points out this morning , the goods which are now cut off , are the very goods whose export has been declining - while the goods which Cuba can still buy - such as foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals - are the goods whose export has declined relatively little . In addition , the State Department admits that Castro has refused to pay for about one-quarter of the American goods he has received since coming into power .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

These bills - housing , education , medical help , and minimum wage - are vitally important to millions of American - Negroes and whites because they affect all those Americans who are on the lower level of our economic ladder . I strongly support civil rights and I am wholeheartedly committed to the implementation of the platform , but to use civil rights at this time as a method of defeating other bills whose passage are also essential would have meant that the session would have ended in complete failure .	unknown	But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership . Their aim has been : ( 1 ) To block the minimum wage bill ( which in its first year of operation would have raised the wages of an estimated 1 million Negro workers ) , the aged health care , housing , and education bills ( which also would have meant major advances in the rights of our lower income and minority group members ) .

Such a program will be soundly financed ; it will provide a balanced program of basic health services ; it will relieve the burden upon our hospitals by providing incentives for nonhospital care ; it emphasizes preventive medical care ; and it tends to reduce the overall cost of the program by using less expensive yet more effective medical techniques . Enactment of this legislation during the present session will be a fitting climax to this 25th anniversary of the Social Security Act and mark a historic step forward in sustaining the dignity and self-reliance of our Nation 's senior citizens .	unknown	Only that approach can provide the required protection in a satisfactory way . Can there really be any doubt that systematic prepayment under the insurance system is to be preferred to the increased drain on general revenues ? Can there be anything but doubt about the ability of the States to raise money - especially when about half of the States now fail to match all the Federal funds at their disposal ? Can we really , in this day and age , say in all honesty that 50 different States with 50 different abilities to finance medical care are to be preferred to an orderly , nationwide system ? Can we really say that we favor social insurance for retirement , survivors and disability benefits , so as to avoid putting the relief tag on our citizens , and then make an exception when they become ill ?

Until a Democrat is in the White house , the Republicans can block action on an adequate minimum wage , they can water down medical care for the aged , they can play politics with civil rights , they can block action on a decent housing bill and a good school bill . But they can not block the American people on November 8.

Other Republicans attacked minimum wage as  communism  and the  road to economic hell  - 93 percent of the Republicans in Congress voted to kill the bill calling for a 25-cent minimum wage and the Republicans have opposed every increase in the minimum wage ever since .

The good neighbor policy is no longer enough .	unknown	But the warning was ignored , and communism grows in strength and influence . In 1955 Mr. Nixon went to Cuba to view conditions for himself . But his only reaction was to praise  the competence and stability  of the Batista dictatorship which was , even then , threatened by Communist activities - and to say that  communism has reached its high-water mark in Latin America  at a time when Communist influence was beginning to rise , and only a few short years before the Communists took over all of Cuba .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

Mr. Nixon 's statement in Phoenix is just another example of how he talks out of both sides of his mouth .	unknown	For Mr. Nixon to say we ca n't afford to do more to clear our slums is downgrading America .

All I can say is this : On three great issues - the Formosa Straits , the President 's conduct at the summit conference , when he refused to apologize to Khrushchev , as he should have refused to apologize to him --- [ Cheers and applause . ] And then on Cuba - Senator Kennedy has said one thing , President Eisenhower has said another - President Eisenhower has been right , Senator Kennedy has been wrong - and the American people know it . [ Cheers and applause .	unknown	That 's the kind of thing you 're confronted with , with him . And then again on Cuba , a similar pattern - saying that our policy of quarantine was too little and too late , and then advocating policies that were universally interpreted as being intervention in that particular area , which would have violated every treaty we have with our sister organization of American States , and also the U.N. Charter , in the process . These were mistakes .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	816	I stand for programs , in addition , which will build the schools that America needs . We stand for programs which will provide for increased and better medical care for our citizens , and particularly for those who need it , who are in the older age brackets - and I will discuss that more a little later . We stand for progress in all of these fields , and certainly , as I stand here before you , I am proud to be a part of that platform and of that program .	unknown	He promises a farm program that would force drastic cutbacks in production and marketing , force 2 million people out of work , trigger off inflation , sharply raise food prices , create food scarcity , and regiment all agriculture by setting up all sorts of new regulations and creating new battalions of Government overseers to watch over and tell every farmer what he could or could not do . He promises to impose a mandatory medical care plan for the aged on every one of the millions of citizens covered by social security , no matter what their personal desires , and leave 3 million Americans with no medical care program at all . My plan would not be compulsory and would provide medical care programs for all those who needed and wanted them .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	819	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people . But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .	unknown	But our goals are not the same . I want a $ 1.25 an hour minimum wage , medical care for the aged through social security , Federal aid to help raise teachers salaries as well as schools , an adequate program of slum clearance and low-rent housing , and a program of aid to areas of chronic unemployment which would include northern Minnesota . These are my goals .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	820	The harsh facts of the matter are that our security and leadership have both been slipping away from us , that the balance of world power has been shifting slowly to the Soviet - Red Chinese bloc and that our own shores have been , for the first time since 1812 , imperiled by chinks in our defensive armor . You sit in Miami , today , 90 miles from the shore of Cuba . For the first time in the history of the United States an enemy stands poised at the throat of the United States .	unknown	This is a great country , but it deserves the best that we have . I suppose 30 or 40 years ago , before the second administration of Woodrow Wilson , people who lived in this valley worried about their farms and their jobs , and now we worry about your farms and your jobs , but we worry about Cuba and the Congo and India and Indonesia , and the security of our families , and the chances for peace .

political	822	The next President of the United States will face problems unlike those any President ever faced before . Here at home we are only beginning to sense the impact of automation , machines replacing men , we are only beginning to feel the pressures on our schools and colleges - on the cost of medical care for the aged - on farms caught in a cost-price squeeze - in cities caught in a downward spiral of slums , high taxes , and the flight to outlying areas . The world is changing , too .	unknown	[ Applause . ] During the last session of the Congress in August , we offered on the floor of the U.S. Senate a bill which would tie medical care for the aged to the social security system .

political	824	We occupy a position of leadership in the world , but I think we can do far better , than our record of the past 2 or 3 or 4 years . Can you tell me anywhere in a crisis , from Cuba to the Congo to Laos , where the United States has been ahead of events ? We have held out our hands of friendship to the people of Latin America before we had to , where we did it at our own free will rather than at the point of Castro 's pistol ? We go now and offer a program of Africa to the United Nations . We offer a program of aid ; We offer scholarships to the Congo .	unknown	It is rather interesting that Mr. Nixon in Havana , Cuba , in 1955 , gave an interview in which he spoke rather glowingly of the stability of the Batista regime . It seems to me it would have been far more valuable for us to be striking a blow for freedom , to stand for freedom , to use our great influence , which we had in Cuba at that time to persuade Batista to hold free elections , so that the people of Cuba could have a free choice . The fact of the matter is that when I was in Cuba 4 years ago , the American Ambassador said to me he was the second most powerful man in Cuba .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	825	Governor Rockefeller 's position on the medical care , as we both indicated prior to the convention , has differed from the position that I have taken . He favors financing the medical care out of Social Security and I favor the Federal - State program , which was contained in the Javits bill which , as you recall , was defeated in the Senate . My view is that the bill passed by the last Congress was certainly a great improvement over what we have .	unknown	He 's had some of the same problems that President Eisenhower has had , and he 's handled them with superb skill and superb dignity , and I congratulate him for it . For example , the very quick way that he went to work on asking the legislature to provide for West Virginia 's participation in the new program for medical care for the aged . This is typical of a man of action , a young , vigorous leader of West Virginia .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

On each of these three occasions increases for sharper than those we propose today were put into effect without injury to employees , inflation , or unemployment .

It would provide areas of chronic unemployment with the tools which can bring new industry and new jobs to men who want to work , have the capacity to work but are unable to find work .

political	828	He was only talking about theory . And as far as Cuba was concerned , he really meant to say the same thing we 've been doing all the time , to give moral support to freedom throughout the world .  Let me say this : you can forgive a candidate for his mistakes , because when he makes them , he can take them back , as Senator Kennedy did on these three issues .	unknown	If he pursued the programs he had advocated domestically - programs which could only produce cruel inflation and Government interference with every aspect of our economic life - he could only pipe us into recession , or worse . If he pursued the policies abroad which he has suggested - apology to Khrushchev , retreat in the Pacific , open interference in Cuba - could only pipe us into grave international crises , or worse .

If elected , he says , he will counsel with President Eisenhower about how to deal with it .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	829	His figures are wholly fictitious . But how can anyone figure the cost of the Republican platform ? How much have they cost the taxpayer for the dams and highways that cost more now than they did when they should have been built ? How can you measure the cost of increased juvenile delinquency bred in the slums they refuse to clean up ? How can you measure the cost to their families of the medical care aged persons are denied ? How can you measure the cost every consumer bears in high interest rates - or the cost of an abandoned farms - or the cost of illness caused by polluted water ? How much more are emergency programs in foreign aid costing us because we did not long ago take the steps we should have taken before a crisis was reached in the Middle East , in Latin America or in Africa ? And how do you measure the cost to a country whose security is in danger of being nibbled away by brush-fire wars too limited to justify the use of the massive retaliation our defense budgets have forced us to rely upon ? I do not call that economy . The Republican Party is one of waste - the waste of our human resources and the waste of our natural resources .	unknown	I believe the issue is very clear , and the people of this State should understand them . They are between a party which regards $ 1.25 minimum wage as too extreme , a party and a candidate which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as too extreme , between a party which vetoes an area redevelopment bill as too extreme , between a party which regards a progressive farm policy which will bring supply and demand into balance as too extreme . Now , if you regard those programs as extreme , I believe you should support Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party .	unknown	support	medical care,health care

Why are we losing the lead to Russia ? Why are n't we meeting the Communist challenge - from Cuba to the Congo , from India to Indonesia ? Four years ago the cold war was being carried on thousands of miles away . This year it spread to within 90 miles of Florida to Cuba . And next week when Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro arrive in New York they will bring the cold war to within 12 miles of the Bergen Mall .	unknown	And only a stronger America can hope to maintain its freedom and the freedom of the world . We are faced with an enemy which now commands a vast empire from the Formosa Straits to Berlin - an enemy whose agents of subversion are penetrating into Africa , into Asia , and now stand only 90 miles from our shores in Cuba - an enemy which is convinced of its ultimate victory - which believes , to quote Mr. Khrushchev ,  that the old and the rotten will always fight with the newly emerged , but it is a law of history that the new will always win .  But it is freedom that is new , and despotism and tyranny that is as old as civilization is - and it is freedom that will win - not because of any law of history - but because we will have the strength and the determination that will bring the victory .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

I do n't believe that anyone who believes in Federal aid to education , and to make sure that our teachers are well compensated - anyone who believes that that is extreme , I do n't believe the American people are going to endorse that leadership .	unknown	I believe the American people prefer their experience under the Democratic Party .

political	834	But the burden which should concern us most lies upon the American conscience . We can no longer tolerate growing patches of poverty and injustice in America - substandard wages , unemployment , city slums , inadequate medical care , inferior education and the sad plight of migratory workers . The enactment of this bill is only one step , but an essential step forward , as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation .	unknown	It means jobs and homes and schools for our children .

political	835	But the hard facts of the matter are that we have fewer than 100 people in the entire Federal Government working on these problems . And the result has been that this country has not been prepared for any disarmament , arms control or atomic testing conference that has taken place since the end of the Korean war . I have proposed in the Congress the establishment of a National Peace Agency - an Arms Control Research Institute - and the next President of the United States must take this step to pave the way for peace .	unknown	First , it has been suggested that your objective is to pose as a champion of peace and disarmament .

He represents a party which voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties , and voted 90 percent against $ 1.25 minimum wage in 1960 . He represents a party which has opposed the strengthening of our educational system , which has opposed medical care for our older citizens tied to social security , which has brought recession in 1954 , again in 1958 , and has brought us to an economic slowdown in the vital year of 1960 .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	839	It is a program like this which is the ultimate answer to Castro and the Communists . For if Latin America is moving forward , if it is progressing under democratic government , then eventually the people of Cuba too will demand freedom for themselves , and Communist rule in Latin America will perish where it began - in the streets of Havana . I believe in a Western Hemisphere where we in the United States do not speak atronizingly of  our backyard  or our  little brothers ,  and where the people of South America do not speak with hostility of the  colossus of the north  or shout  Yankee go home .	unknown	Yet we have done almost nothing to keep Castro from consolidating his regime and beginning subversive activities throughout Latin America . In fact , our prestige in Latin America has fallen so low that - at the recent Inter - American Foreign Ministers Conference - we were unable to persuade our former good neighbors to pass a resolution even criticizing Cuba by name . Now , 2 years later , following blunder after blunder , defeat after defeat , the Republicans decide to combat communism by cutting off exports long after the time has passed when such a move might have had a really significant impact - long after our Cuban exports have declined drastically - and long after , as Mr. Nixon must privately recognize , Mr. Castro himself had already embarked on a deliberate program to cut down American exports .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	841	He criticized administration farm vetoes . He stressed , and I quote him ,  The necessity for the restoration of cordial relations with Latin America  and he called for more effective action against disarmament . The Democratic nominee in 1928 spoke 30 years ago tonight about building a stronger America , strengthening not only our economy but our sense of moral purpose and our public duty .	unknown	For peace will not come solely through the conference room and the propaganda machine . Rather the road to a world at peace runs through a revitalized and growing American economy , through the arduous construction of defenses so powerful that the Communists know that peace is their only alternative , through vast research projects to solve the complex difficulties of controlling modern arms , through carefully prepared disarmament programs to be presented by skilled and experienced negotiators , and through the exercise of a firm Presidential leadership which will never allow either our own representatives or the rest of the world to wonder what our position is , to wonder indeed , if we have any position at all , or to doubt the sincerity of our desire for disarmament . Words alone will never impress Mr. Khrushchev .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	843	Second , peace requires an America that is planning and preparing and striving for disarmament . Under this administration , less than 100 people have been working in the entire Federal Government on the vital subject of disarmament , a subject deeply complicated and in some ways requiring more modern scientific experiments than the preparation of instruments of war . After all these years , the present administration is now talking of establishing a special arms control agency in the executive branch .	unknown	In other words , maintaining a position of equality permits you to negotiate more successfully .

He makes campaign promises to help our distressed areas and our unemployed workers - but as Vice President he has consistently opposed our party 's efforts , sparked by Senator Douglas , to get such measures enacted .	unknown	Mr. Nixon voted against it , every single time , and I voted for it .

We did not do as well as I thought we should have done .	unknown	[ Applause . ] The Republican Party , which in 1935 voted almost unanimously against the 25-cent minimum wage , voted almost unanimously against the $ 1.25 in 1960 .

I am sure that the threat of a White House veto mentioned by every speaker opposing the amendment contributed to this defeat .	unknown	He may have had reasons for doing it , but I never mentioned that vote .

Eisenhower , not Kennedy - and that 's the kind of policy-- Point 3 : and this most recently , and certainly one of the greatest mistakes ever made by a presidential candidate in the history of this country , indicating that he would directly intervene in Cuba , the Government of the United States moving into that situation . What would that have done ? Lose us all our friends in Latin America , lose us our influence in the United Nations , because we would have broken every treaty if we had done what he wanted us to do .	unknown	We have participated in the discussions leading to these great decisions , and as far as the record is concerned , we are part of it ; we are proud of it , and I think that the American people know what we will do when a crisis comes . As far as our opponent is concerned , I would only suggest this : We have a pretty good idea what he would do , too , and , based on what he has said in this campaign , how he disagreed with the President on Quemoy and Matsu , how he suggested that the President could have apologized to Khrushchev at Paris , is almost certainly the most irresponsible proposal ever advocated by a Presidential candidate with regard to Cuba - when you consider these things , I say that we can not afford the inexperience of a man like that as President of the United States . And , of course , some people may well say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , he 's changed his mind about Quemoy and Matsu .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	854	Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others . Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring .	unknown	We are already racing from the jet age to the space age before meeting the safety , airport development , and other problems of the former . Space exploration that unravels the secrets of our universe , reconnaissance satellites that can replace a hundred U-2 planes watching over all the world , civilian travel in space vehicles , and the rule of law and disarmament in space itself , all these lie ahead of this generation . But we need not look only to the skies for new horizons .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	855	On that vote , 44 Democrats voted  aye  and 1 Republican Senator voted  aye .  I want to make it clear that in my judgment the only way you are going to protect the interest of the country , the only way you are going to be able to provide a program which pays for itself , the only way you are going to provide medical care for the aged , is through the social security system which has worked for 25 years . [ Applause .	unknown	I have confidence in our ability to close the missile gap , to modernize our conventional forces and to give this country the kind of defensive strength that Stuart Symington has been warning for years we will need if we are going to remain free at the end of the next years . I have confidence in this Nation 's ability to look out for its older citizens , to see that they have a decent pension and a decent home and decent medical care .

You 're not going to continue it in Michigan , and I say we 're not going to have that kind of government for all the 50 States of the United States by sending it to Washington , D.C. When you think that programs of our opponents would each year cost approximately the whole gold reserve of this country , you can get an example of what this spending can mean - and I say to you that I am going to fight for all those programs that we need - in education , in medical care , in all the rest - that will spell progress ; but , my friends , I am going to oppose every program that will raise taxes or raise prices for the American people , because I know that 's what you need and what you want . And I say to you today that , as we make that fight for you , we are making it because we realize that the money we spend , the promises we make ; are not paid by our money , and not by Jack 's money , either , but by yours .	unknown	I know that as my mother and father reached their seventies they had some difficult times because of illness , and I know that there 's nothing that touches the hearts of children more than to think of their parents and the problems that they have then . That 's one of the reasons why we have a program in the field of medical care for the older citizens - not one like our opponents ' that would n't take care of 3 million of the people who do n't happen to be on social security , but one that will give an opportunity for every older person in this country who wants health insurance coverage to have it . , but which will require nobody to have it against his will .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

A year ago when we went to the disarmament conference , we appointed an attorney from Massachusetts to set up an ad hoc committee .

Sixth , I think we must formulate special programs which will be of assistance in those areas which are chronically hard hit by unemployment , areas where it is 7 , 8 , 9 , or 10 percent , and it may have gone on for 2 or 3 years . I had one of them in my own State , Lawrence , Mass .	unknown	First , we must spur the rate of national economic growth so as to take up the slack now existing in heavy industry - such as steel , chemicals , and autos - and in service industries - such as building and construction . Secondly , we must administer existing defense and other Federal procurement programs in a manner that , consistent with the national interest , areas with idle facilities and idle skills are given priority before those skills are disgraced and chronic unemployment takes over .

But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .	unknown	Thank you very much . Mr. Nixon 's contention that the hard-hit unemployment areas of the country would have received more help under the administration area redevelopment bill than under the Douglas - Flood bill , which I supported and which President Eisenhower vetoed , is patently absurd .

Why did n't we ? That is what he said a month ago ; why did n't we in 1955 come forward with a program that would have prevented Castro from taking power ? When he was there in 1955 , he said , and you can judge his experience ,  I am convinced that communism has passed its highwater mark in Latin America ,  at a time when the Communists were about to communize Cuba . Our third failure has been our inability to establish contact with the young people of that area that will run the country .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	862	The Republican leadership of the Senate knows full well that under the parliamentary situation of these final crowded weeks - and in the political atmosphere of rancor that developed - no significant civil rights measure could have passed . This same political atmosphere has also prevented action on a farm bill and on adequate minimum wage , housing , health care for the aged , and education bills . But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership .	unknown	A Republican candidate and a Republican President , representing as he does those interests and members of the Republican Party , must take a particular position on a particular issue . Is it any accident that for the last 25 years the Republicans have voted against the minimum wage nearly every time ? They voted against the 25 cents in 1935 , and they voted against the $ 1.25 in 1960 . They voted against the social security in 1935 , and they voted against the medical care for the aged in 1960 .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	863	It does not depend upon the uncertainties of financing from general revenues . I feel strongly that there must be no means test in providing medical care insurance . Already 2 1/4 million of our older citizens must rely on public assistance for their daily needs .	unknown	After the convention , we did pass a minimum wage bill of $ 1.25 in the Senate . We failed by five votes on medical care for the aged tied to social security . The Rules Committee of the House did not release education or housing for a vote in the House .	unknown	support	medical care,health care
political	867	There are only two reasons , in my opinion , for an unbalanced budget . One , if there is a great national emergency requiring an expenditure by the Federal Government to protect the security of the United States , or , two , if there is serious unemployment which requires action by the Federal Government . The most serious , potent peacetime deficit in the history of the United States was in 1958 , when we ran a $ 12 billion deficit .	unknown	Throughout the entire Nation men and women - almost 4 million of them - are looking for jobs . Economists tell us that an unemployment rate of 6 percent is the danger signal . When a community passes that point it is officially regarded as an area of  substantial labor surplus .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	868	They are equally entitled to share in economic progress . The fiscal burden of an inadequate minimum wage law lies upon the community , and thus upon every taxpayer . In New York City , 44 percent of the families to whom relief is extended include those who are wage earners but whose incomes are inadequate .	unknown	But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership . Their aim has been : ( 1 ) To block the minimum wage bill ( which in its first year of operation would have raised the wages of an estimated 1 million Negro workers ) , the aged health care , housing , and education bills ( which also would have meant major advances in the rights of our lower income and minority group members ) . A majority of Republicans voted against the minimum wage bill , all but one voted against social security health care for the aged and not one Republican on the House Rules Committee was ready to let adequate education and housing bills come up for final action .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	870	It does not depend upon the uncertainties of financing from general revenues . I feel strongly that there must be no means test in providing medical care insurance . Already 2 1/4 million of our older citizens must rely on public assistance for their daily needs .	unknown	This last session of the Congress for the last 4 weeks is a vivid example of what can happen when the country is divided in its leadership ; because the Republican Party opposed the $ 1.25 minimum wage , we did n't get it . Because the Republican Party - and only one Senator voted against them - opposed medical care for the aged tied to social security , which had the endorsement of Governor Rockefeller , as well as the Democratic Party , and it was beaten by five votes . And Time magazine this week said that the leader of the Republican Party smiled when he heard the results - this is the kind of thing which has happened in the month of August .	unknown	support	medical care,health care
political	871	When a political party votes , in 1935 , 98 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage , I know what the party stands for ; and when that same political party in 1960 votes in the House of Representatives 85 percent against $ 1.25 minimum wage in 1960 , I know the Republican Party stands where it has always stood-against ; not for , but against . Mr. Nixon leads a party which regards $ 1.25 minimum wage as extreme , which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as extreme . Mr. Nixon leads a party which Alf Landon once led , from Pennsylvania .	unknown	It is our function , however , not to merely invoke the names of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman , not to merely live off what they did , but to bring these old programs up to date . Franklin Roosevelt proposed a 25-cent minimum wage , back in the middle thirties ; 90 percent of the Republicans voted against it . We proposed this summer a minimum wage of $ 1.25 and 90 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives voted against it .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	872	No. I think we had to come back . I think it would have been a much bigger mistake for us to say that we were not going to do anything about these matters , and that we were going to adjourn and not do anything about some of the appropriation bills , the Antarctic Treaty , education , housing , minimum wage , and care of the aged , that we were not going to try . We did not do as well as I thought we should have done .	unknown	Anybody who says that there is nothing left for us to do has not read the paper , does n't know what is left for the United States to do in its unfinished business here at home . As long as this administration refuses to pass a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , as long as this administration vetoes housing bills , as long as this administration refuses to pass legislation for medical care for our older citizens , as long as there is not equality of opportunity for all Americans regardless of their race or their religion , there is unfinished business for our generation . I stand here where Harry Truman stood and Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson in this century .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	875	Do we want that from our President ? No. Our President goes before the United Nations . He comes out with an honest program of disarmament . Not one which is naive , because , as the President says , America must never disarm unless we have guarantees that the Khrushchevs and the others will also reduce their armaments at the same time .	unknown	[ Applause . ] President Eisenhower is n't setting up a phony disarmament scheme as Khrushchev is .

political	876	He knows it , the economy is moving up . He knows that unemployment went down more than seasonally last month and employment went up more than seasonally , and you know a funny thing ? In that same Detroit paper that I saw was an eight-column head  Kennedy Predicts Recession .  You know what an eight-column head right underneath it was ?  Auto Sales at an Alltime High in America .	unknown	 Is it true ? And the answer is , Of course it is n't true . The answer is - and now I 'm going to give you my version - the answer is that America , is moving forward , that unemployment went down more than usual last month and employment went up to record heights . The answer is that America will continue to move forward , continue to move forward , that is , unless we have some of our politicians talk us into a recession - and we are n't going to allow that to happen .	unknown	support	unemployment
political	877	Today the country has 126 areas of substantial labor surplus , areas of declining industry , where there is poverty and hunger , where men have been searching for work , but can not find that work . Unemployment in any of these areas harms the entire Nation , depriving all our industry of markets , decreasing total purchasing power , and depriving us of needed production . The distress may be regional , but the problem is a national problem .	unknown	First , we must spur the rate of national economic growth so as to take up the slack now existing in heavy industry - such as steel , chemicals , and autos - and in service industries - such as building and construction . Secondly , we must administer existing defense and other Federal procurement programs in a manner that , consistent with the national interest , areas with idle facilities and idle skills are given priority before those skills are disgraced and chronic unemployment takes over . Third , to that end , we will repass , and I would sign , the depressed-areas bill twice vetoed by the Republicans .	unknown	support	unemployment
political	878	And , finally , instead of the hoped-for general relaxation of world tension , the Soviets have stepped up their efforts to create disorder , danger and division . They have established an Iron Curtain outpost only 90 miles from our shores in the once friendly nation of Cuba . They have , for the first time , extended their sphere of influence into Africa .	unknown	It is rather interesting that Mr. Nixon in Havana , Cuba , in 1955 , gave an interview in which he spoke rather glowingly of the stability of the Batista regime . It seems to me it would have been far more valuable for us to be striking a blow for freedom , to stand for freedom , to use our great influence , which we had in Cuba at that time to persuade Batista to hold free elections , so that the people of Cuba could have a free choice . The fact of the matter is that when I was in Cuba 4 years ago , the American Ambassador said to me he was the second most powerful man in Cuba .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	879	Secondly , peace requires an America that is planning , preparing , and striving for disarmament and other steps toward peace . Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations . A successful blueprint for a safe disarmament is as difficult to devise as a successful blueprint for modern war .	unknown	Why , then , Mr. Khrushchev , have you decided to come ? It has been suggested that you may have four possible objectives in mind . First , it has been suggested that your objective is to pose as a champion of peace and disarmament . You are said to be bringing new disarmament proposals with you .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	880	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	unknown	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return . I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise . I know that that kind of firmness is what leads to peace .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	883	The figure prior to this was 8 percent , which had 8 percent over a period of a year or 18 months . I believe that that program could be useful in using defense contracts most of which are not by bid but which are negotiated , to put those in areas where it is possible , where there is chronic unemployment and little hope for new industry . I would feel both of those , plus the coal research bill , plus the national fuels policy , I believe all of those would be of assistance in eastern Kentucky and these other hard-hit areas .	unknown	By pursuing this goal we keep faith with those who save ; we protect those who live on a fixed income ; and we build world confidence in the soundness and integrity of the dollar . It is equally urgent that we do not achieve this kind of stability at the expense of any one group in the economy , such as farmers - or at the price of recessions , unemployment , and stagnation . I believe we can keep our prices stable while maintaining higher and more stable levels of production and employment .	unknown	support	unemployment
political	884	These are the times that you can read and have the time to read that you will never have later , and you can get the opportunity to specialize much later . You can learn about political science by participating in political organizations , and I would say certainly a political science course under the very able people who instruct you in our colleges and universities is worth while , but particularly to those who want to enter public service , if I could leave just one note - Remember , that while the broad background in the humanities and history and literature would seem to be very remote from the problems of Ghana and Cuba , from the problems of what we do about health care and what we do about the filibuster , remember those are the courses that will give you the judgment and the depth that is needed to react properly and intelligently to these great issues when they come before you years later , if you happen to enter public life . The last point that I would make is this : I want everybody here to certainly feel the necessity for , as I put it , going into politics ; I do n't mean all of you should run for office .	unknown	They 're going to stir up trouble . We 're going to have trouble not only in Cuba but in Japan and all over the world . Why ? Because they 're going to stir them up .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	886	Now , if you regard those programs as extreme , I believe you should support Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party . But if you believe that you can not have a prosperous town in this State if your agricultural income continues to drop , if you recognize that under the program which Mr. Nixon put forward , which is a continuation of the Benson program , and corn which sold 8 years ago for $ 1.50 sells in this State at 95 cents today , will sell next year at 80 cents , and down and down it will go , because this administration 's farm program provides for a free market price , and the free market price for corn in this country with unlimited production will take that down at least 20 percent below what it is selling at today , and if any merchant in this State feels he can prosper with corn on the downward trend , with unemployment in this State , at 6.8 percent to 7 percent , any merchant in this country who feels he can move forward when steel production is at 50 percent of capacity , which it is in the United States , when 7 out of 8 International Harvester plants in Illinois closed down in the last 2 weeks , and they may open some of them in October - if that is the kind of country you want and that is the kind of economy you believe in , if those are the programs you want , I believe you should vote for Mr. Nixon . But if you believe it is time this country moved forward , if you believe we have stood on dead center long enough , if you believe that the balance of power in the world should shift in our direction instead of against us , if you believe that the United States should be first - not first but , if , sometimes or perhaps , but first , period .	unknown	For in 1960 , as in 1932 , people are in trouble . There may not be mass unemployment , but there is creeping unemployment - in steel , in textiles , in coal , in housing . There may not be soup kitchens , but there are depressed areas in Buffalo and Pittsburgh and West Virginia and Kentucky .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	888	But if that is what the American people want , if they want to close in and let the future pass them by , take Mr. Nixon . But if you want to move again , if you want this country to meet its responsibilities , if you have confidence that there is nothing we can not do , once given the opportunity to do so , if you believe that people want to be free as they do , that Khrushchev and Castro and the rest of them represent a system which is as old as time , domination of one man by another , which goes against the grain of every person whether they live in the Soviet Union or whether they live in Cuba - they want to be free . They may be misled , they may be dominated by a police state , they may be scared in other countries that the tide is moving in the direction of the Communists .	unknown	And the slight impact which Mr. Nixon 's latest policy will have - is even more diluted by our complete failure to seek the cooperation of our allies - thus making it simple for Mr. Castro to turn to other South American and European nations for those few goods which he ca n't get from Russia or Red China . For 6 years before Castro came to power the Republicans did absolutely nothing to stop the rise of communism in Cuba . Our Ambassadors repeatedly warned the Republicans of mounting danger .	unknown	support	cuba
political	889	To meet this distress , the Democrats proposed that the medical expenses of retired Americans be financed through the social security system . But Mr. Nixon and the Republicans opposed medical care for the aged and they managed to defeat it in the Congress .

One of the reasons why we have never been able to get an agreement on the disarmament of outer space is because we are second in outer space , and the Soviet Union will not give way their advantage . We arm to parley , and we must be strong if we are going to disarm and maintain our security .	unknown	We are already racing from the jet age to the space age before meeting the safety , airport development , and other problems of the former . Space exploration that unravels the secrets of our universe , reconnaissance satellites that can replace a hundred U-2 planes watching over all the world , civilian travel in space vehicles , and the rule of law and disarmament in space itself , all these lie ahead of this generation .

Why are we losing the lead to Russia ? Why are n't we meeting the Communist challenge - from Cuba to the Congo , from India to Indonesia ? Four years ago the cold war was being carried on thousands of miles away . This year it spread to within 90 miles of Florida to Cuba . And next week when Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro arrive in New York they will bring the cold war to within 12 miles of the Bergen Mall .	unknown	We can not be committed by a party of the past . We can not wait for Mr. Khrushchev 's words , for the Communists are not satisfied with their gains of the last months , with their lead in missiles and space , and their foothold in Cuba , and half of Indochina , and their new influence in Laos and Africa and Asia .

In other words , to pass a minimum wage bill which brings wages up to date . The first minimum wage bill in 1935 was 25 cents an hour .	unknown	[ Response from the audience . ] I want someone to tell me a single piece of domestic legislation that Mr. Nixon ever proposed that stood for progress for the people , from minimum wage , social security - this summer we tried to pass a bill for medical care for the older citizens .

It would , as we have seen from the immediate response of shock and dismay in Latin America , alienate every one of our sister American Republics whose friendship you have acknowledged is of vital importance to our efforts against communism . 3.

I could talk on many subjects tonight - the need for an effective minimum wage ; the medical care for the aged ; of Federal aid to education , and all the rest . But I 'm going to talk about an issue which goes to the survival of the United States .	unknown	A Vice President who was a Congressman in 1949 opposed public housing , is part of the same administration which in 1959 vetoed two housing bills . Are the people of Illinois and the people of this city and the people of this district to have a change to determine what kind of government they want here in this State and across the country ? Do you feel that everything that has to be done to provide better working conditions for our people and better housing , and medical care for the aged , which affects us all , because we all have someone in our family that needs assistance - and under the bill which the Congress passed and which was signed by the administration , before anyone can get medical aid , they have to sign a petition that they are indigent , that they are broke , that they have expended their money , that they are paupers . I believe in medical care for the aged , nursing care , all tied to social security , which has served our people so well for 25 years .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	897	 This letter from this 12-year-old boy sums up the concern that I found all over the United States as we have traveled this country north , east , west , and south . This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	unknown	They would have thought of the people and we would have had a bill that would have done something about it . I say to you today , and I pledge to you , that America , first , can not afford to allow any pockets of unemployment to exist . We can not afford not to use the tremendous human resources that are here in this area that are not being used .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	899	Let me speak now of a more important issue . I am sure when you heard the words  more important  some of you thought :  What could be more important than education for our children , a better job , adequate hospitals and health care , all these things that I have mentioned ?  The answer is :  We can have the best social security system , the best education , the best jobs that we can imagine , and it is not going to do any good unless we are around to enjoy them .  So I urge all of you , without regard to your partisan affiliations , to have this major issue in mind as you go to the polls on election day :  Which of the two candidates , which of the two tickets , do you believe best provides the kind of leadership that will keep the peace for America and keep it without a surrender of principle ?  Here we think we have a good record .	unknown	Now , people disagree with that . Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson believe that the social security route , which would compel all people - whether they wanted health insurance or not - to , in effect , have it through subscribing to social security , is the best one to provide medical care or people over 65 . I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	900	What have they done since President Taft ? What have they done on social secunty and minimum wages and housing and resource development , on which they run and issue papers today ? Where do they stand when those measures were proposed ? Where do they stand in 1960 when we tried to move the minimum wage from $ 1 an hour to $ 1.25 ? Mr. Nixon says it is too extreme . When we try to provide medical care for the aged on social security , instead they pass a bill by which you have to take a pauper 's oath before you are entitled to medical care . What do they do on resource development ? Their policy was officially called  No new starts .	unknown	That is the same party that voted 90 percent against 25 cents minimum wage . I do n't lead a party which voted 90 percent against social security , which ran a presidential candidate , Alf Landon , in 1936 , calling for the repeal of social security , and yet that is the same party in 1960 that voted against medical care for the aged .

political	902	This revolution in nationhood has been but one of several other revolutions , all of which have been going on at the same time - and all of tremendous importance to history . There is the revolution in transportation and communication which is shrinking our world with every passing day ; there is the revolution in medicine which is enabling human beings to become healthier and live longer ; the revolution in automation , which increases our abundance , but also our unemployment ; the revolution of farm production , which could bring the eventual elimination of hunger in the world , but which so far has only brought disaster to the farm family ; the revolution of our exploding urban population which brings with it the problems of overerowded schools , urban blight , and crowded slums . There is the revolution in education , which sees more and more of our young people going to college , while two-thirds of the world 's population still remains illiterate ; the tremendously exciting revolution in space , which will soon carry man to other worlds undreamed of ; and the equally exciting and morally refreshing revolution for human rights for all citizens here at home .	unknown	And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

How can you talk of colonialism when you are surrounded by your puppet dictators and when you hold in an iron grip a great empire stretching from East Berlin to Vietnam ? How can you talk of the achievements of your system , even if you beat us again by putting a man into outer space ?

And nowhere has the impact of Republican unemployment been greater than in the 126 sections of this country which are classified as areas of chronic labor surplus , areas where large numbers of men , long out of work , can not find new jobs , areas where unemployment compensation checks are runnning out , where industry has declined or collapsed , where families struggle for the bare essentials of a decent life , where thousands are forced to depend on meager and inadequate Government surplus food packages for existence . These are the rapidly growing islands of poverty in the midst of a rich and abundant America - islands which have been growing in number and expanding in size under the leadership of a Republican Party which is indifferent to the urgent human needs of our own people and which has fought against every effort of the Democratic Party to eliminate poverty and distress in America .	unknown	Senator John F.

Now , you have to decide which party and which candidate based on their history , based on their statements in this campaign , based on their look into the future , can lead this country into the dangerous years of the 1960 's , which party and which candidate and which viewpoint can build in this country a strong society which will serve as an inspiration to the people around the world .	unknown	 But in the next breath he tells us that we ca n't afford to do those things in America that everybody knows we need to do .

Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , tonight expressed strong satisfaction with the minimum wage bill , voted by the Senate 62 to 34 .

I have confidence in an America able to afford the best schools and the best teachers in the world - an America where no one is denied his full constitutional rights by reason of his race or religion - an America where every family lives in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - an America where the cost of living is not completely beyond those who work for a living - particularly those receiving an inadequate minimum wage of $ 1 an hour .

And I can assure you that if Mr. Nixon can travel across this great land and remain indifferent to the problems of unemployment and economic slow-down which afflict many sections of America - problems which he is seeing at first hand - his vision will be no clearer and his awareness no greater from the White House in far-away Washington . For the Mr. Nixon who can look upon your distress - and say all is well - is the same Mr. Nixon who , in the past 8 years , has led the fight against every Democratic measure designed to increase the welfare of the American people - to put men back to work - and to help rebuild the economically distressed areas of America .	unknown	support	unemployment

We have a minimum wage , but to be of any help at today 's prices it must be raised to $ 1.25 an hour .

And finally , although 9 million Americans over the age of 65 receive incomes of less than $ 20 a week - and 3 million more receive incomes of less than $ 40 a week - amounts on which they can not afford their higher medical bills - the Republican Party , only 2 weeks ago , blocked our efforts to provide medical care for the aged under social security .

We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	 This letter from this 12-year-old boy sums up the concern that I found all over the United States as we have traveled this country north , east , west , and south . This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	unknown	support	unemployment

I know the American labor movement opposes what I oppose : complacency , unemployment , economic stagnation , and national insecurity .	unknown	And in both 1958 and 1959 , an average of more than 1 million idle workers remained out of a job for more than 15 week - the highest number since before the war . These figures tell a human story - the story of unemployment benefits running out - of 3 million Americans force to live on an unhealthy , tasteless diet of surplus foods - a story of hardship and personal tragedy . What , then , does Mr. Nixon mean when he says we are enjoying the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed ? Perhaps he believes that if only 1 out of every 10 Americans are unable to find full-time work , the other 9 out of every 10 must be doing all right .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

( 4 ) Unemployment : Mr. Nixon , who thinks several million unemployed is inevitable and nothing to worry about , is satisfied today with what he calls our  unprecedented prosperity  - but I think we can do better in putting our unemployed back to work , using our idle capacity in steel , coal and other industries , and finding jobs for the thousands of young men and women who are pouring into our labor market every week of the year . ( 5 ) Trusting the voters : Mr. Nixon and the Republicans are unwilling to reveal to the American people reports containing the facts about our prestige , the truth about the Nixon - Khrushchev talks , the basis of the present missile gap as contained in the Gaither report , and the facts about whether we are heading for a third recession prepared by the Department of Commerce .	unknown	I think that you know the issues of this campaign well . There is no community in the United States in the last 2 or 3 years that has learned a harder lesson of what it means to live under a Republican administration [ applause ] and an administration which has permitted unemployment in this community to double in the last 12 months .

Mr. Nixon has n't mentioned Cuba very prominently in this campaign . He talks about standing firm in Berlin , standing firm in the Far East , standing up to Khrushchev , but he never mentions standing firm in Cuba - and if you ca n't stand up to Castro , how can you be expected to stand up to Khrushchev ? Earlier this month , I reviewed the sorry story of how under our very noses , and in part as the result of our own policies - Cuba had moved from a position of good neighbor to a position of bitter enemy .	unknown	Do you know how many Voice of America programs in Spanish we have had to Latin America in the last 8 years ? None , except for the 3 months of the Hungarian crisis . Do we have a Voice of America program to Cuba today to tell them that Castro is lying , when he speaks about us ? To tell them that we want them to be free , that we believe in the democracy , that we are telling them our story ?

After passing in the U.S. Senate a bill providing for $ l.25 minimum wage , we failed in the conference to secure the passage of that bill . After passing in the Senate of the United States a bill for aid for education , and a bill for aid for housing , we failed to get both of those bills to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote , and every Republican member of the Rules Committee of the House voted against them going to the floor of the House of Representatives .	unknown	[ Applause . ] The Republican Party , which in 1935 voted almost unanimously against the 25-cent minimum wage , voted almost unanimously against the $ 1.25 in 1960 .

Why was not our Latin American capital investment program strengthened in 1958 , after Mr. Nixon was there , instead of this summer at the point of Mr. Castro 's gun ? Why did we not encourage free elections in Cuba after Mr. Nixon was there in 1955 , in order to stave off a revolt against what he called in a Havana press conference in 1955  the competence and stability  of the Batista dictatorship ? Why are we suddenly embarking now on a crash program for African scholarships for students ? Last year we allocated no scholarships at all to the Congo , practically none to other French and Belgian colonies and , indeed , practically none to the continent of Africa itself . We have allocated more scholarships this summer to the Congo than we allocated to all of Africa a year ago .	unknown	It seems to me it would have been far more valuable for us to be striking a blow for freedom , to stand for freedom , to use our great influence , which we had in Cuba at that time to persuade Batista to hold free elections , so that the people of Cuba could have a free choice .

In other words , the Federal Government will loan its credit to businesses that wish to come to areas such as this , will provide vocational retraining for older workers , provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for those who are out of work for a long time , will aid in cleansing the rivers , will aid in trying to bring new industry into this area .	unknown	We are going to have to find in the 1960 's 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years if we are going to maintain full employment in the United States .

Why is it that you stand against the proposals for disarmament that are made by Mr. Khrushchev ? Why is it that we ca n't go more than halfway on these proposals and take some of them on faith ?  I want to tell you why we ca n't . Because if the United States ever enters into a disarmament agreement with the Soviet or with any other potential aggressor which they might break and which we would keep , that would increase the danger of war rather than reduce it and that we must never do .	unknown	I 'm confident of what America can do in the years ahead , provided that Americans know the problems , face up to the challenge , and stay true to the principles that have made this country great . Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well .	unknown	support	disarmament

As a result , we have been unprepared at every disarmament conference that we have attended .

And this would not have happened in Cuba if the Republican leadership Mr. Nixon represents every step which foresight and experience should have directed them to take - in order to prevent a Communist victory only 90 miles from our shores . I do not know how Mr. Nixon can talk of firmness in view of his party 's record in Cuba .	unknown	Mr. Nixon himself was in Latin America 5 years ago and here is what he said :  If we had produced economic progress in Cuba we might have averted the Cuban takeover .

When he was there in 1955 , he said , and you can judge his experience ,  I am convinced that communism has passed its highwater mark in Latin America ,  at a time when the Communists were about to communize Cuba .

When all the vague generalities are stripped away , nothing more is being offered by opponents of the Anderson amendment than an increase in the public assistance program to provide some increased medical care for the indigent .

Now , in the case of medical care for the aged , as I said in my statement , being tied to social security , which I thought was extremely important , as you know in the Senate we secured the support of only one Republican , and we were informed by the minority leader , Mr. Dirksen , when the matter came to a vote , that if we passed social security , it would be vetoed by the President . In the case of the $ 1.25 minimum wage , which was my bill , which we did pass in the Senate by a vote of 2 to 1 , we failed in the conference with the House , after Mr. Dirksen , the minority leader , announced that the President of the United States would veto any bill that had $ 1.25 minimum wage .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

They may be misled , they may be dominated by a police state , they may be scared in other countries that the tide is moving in the direction of the Communists .	unknown	Yet we have done almost nothing to keep Castro from consolidating his regime and beginning subversive activities throughout Latin America . In fact , our prestige in Latin America has fallen so low that - at the recent Inter - American Foreign Ministers Conference - we were unable to persuade our former good neighbors to pass a resolution even criticizing Cuba by name . Now , 2 years later , following blunder after blunder , defeat after defeat , the Republicans decide to combat communism by cutting off exports long after the time has passed when such a move might have had a really significant impact - long after our Cuban exports have declined drastically - and long after , as Mr. Nixon must privately recognize , Mr. Castro himself had already embarked on a deliberate program to cut down American exports .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	unknown	They would use it because their aim is to conquer the world .

Now , in talking to those points , I want to first say that certainly there is no issue that is more important than the one that I mentioned last , because we can have the best jobs and the best education ; we can have the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we are not around to enjoy it .

We have held out our hands of friendship to the people of Latin America before we had to , where we did it at our own free will rather than at the point of Castro 's pistol ? We go now and offer a program of Africa to the United Nations . We offer a program of aid ; We offer scholarships to the Congo .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

We must promptly initiate a major broadcast program for Cuba in particular , and more for the Americas in general . 2. Secondly , we must end the harrassment , which this Government has carried on , of liberty-loving anti-Castro forces in Cuba and in other lands .	unknown	Today , unlike 1940 , the nations of Latin America are distrustful of our guidance , suspicious of our intentions disillusioned by our actions .

And this change has come about in the past 8 years .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

As a result of this failure we have been steadily unprepared on disarmament . Our delegates to international conferences have been inexperienced , understaffed , and inadequately instructed .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1129	I am sure many of you who are listening tonight or viewing this program saw that debate , and you recall there that I and my opponent had a sharp disagreement . I stood with the President 's program with regard to Cuba . I said the program should be one of containing Castro , containing him economically and politically , containing him in this way by a quarantine program , in effect .	unknown	I can tell you that , knowing this man , the moment you make a concession , the moment you give in to that kind of blackmail , it only encourages him to stomp on you , and here again I say : This is how he would have acted had he been President . And then third , the incident on Cuba ; again a point of issue in our debate . Here it was shooting from the hip , but missing the mark , the President taking the correct position of quarantining Mr. Castro , quarantining him by economic and political means , and Mr. Kennedy then saying this is n't enough , we 've got to go further and then making the outrageous suggestion that the Government of the United States should intervene directly - and that 's the way it was interpreted all over the world - into Cuba .	unknown	support	cuba
political	1130	We can go back to the August session of this Congress when there were three bills , which I think tell very well what the issues are in this campaign . One was medical care for the aged tied to social security . Forty-four Democratic Senators supported it , only one Republican , and it is a fact that in the last 7 days the Governor of this State , a Republican , has attacked the program which was passed in this last session of the Congress , because it was not tied to social security .	unknown	I have confidence in our ability to close the missile gap , to modernize our conventional forces and to give this country the kind of defensive strength that Stuart Symington has been warning for years we will need if we are going to remain free at the end of the next years . I have confidence in this Nation 's ability to look out for its older citizens , to see that they have a decent pension and a decent home and decent medical care . The people who oppose this program for medical care under social security are the very same people who fought President Roosevelt in 1935 , the very same people who supported Alf Landon in his campaign in 1936 , running on the single platform of repealing social security .	unknown	support	medical care,health care
political	1131	In it are centered the hopes of the globe around us for freedom and a more secure life . For it is in the Executive Branch that the most crucial decisions of this century must be made in the next four years--how to end or alter the burdensome arms race , where Soviet gains already threaten our very existence--how to maintain freedom and order in the newly emerging nations--how to rebuild the stature of American science and education--how to prevent the collapse of our farm economy and the decay of our cities--how to achieve , without further inflation or unemployment , expanded economic growth benefiting all Americans--and how to give direction to our traditional moral purpose , awakening every American to the dangers and opportunities that confront us .

Today , yesterday , Mr. Castro raised the standard of revolt , the standard of communism through all of Latin America , not merely in Cuba . One or two years ago there was not a country in Africa that was in any danger of moving in the direction of the Communists .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

The heartless inadequacies of the Republican program , the humiliating  pauper 's oath  which many retired workers simply refuse to take , should be of concern to every young family who may some day need to support an aged parent .	unknown	And finally , in 1959 , we passed a bill to provide housing for the elderly , and the administration vetoed it . Lastly , in 1960 , and this is the end of a sad , sad story , when Senator Anderson and I introduced an amendment to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security , do you know how many Republican votes we got ? One ; 44 Democrats and 1 Republican . And do you know when the vote was announced , a great national magazine said ,  Mr .	unknown	support	medical care,health care

During the past 6 years the Democratic Congress has done much to improve these two important enactments .	unknown	They stem from the administration of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman . They are the efforts which Democratic Presidents and Democratic Congresses have made to write into law a whole platform of social legislation , which permits all Americans to participate in our standard of living , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , housing , aid to education , medical care for the aged , all of the great litany of pieces of social legislation for which we are distinguished which make it easy for a Democratic candidate to run for the Presidency , and which Mr. Nixon 's party has opposed .

Why are we losing the lead to Russia ? Why are n't we meeting the Communist challenge - from Cuba to the Congo , from India to Indonesia ? Four years ago the cold war was being carried on thousands of miles away . This year it spread to within 90 miles of Florida to Cuba . And next week when Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro arrive in New York they will bring the cold war to within 12 miles of the Bergen Mall .	unknown	[ Applause . ] But today the Communists stir up their troubles , their anti-American resentment that festers in too many countries , particularly among the people who are hungry , sick , and poor , and almost every area of crisis in the last years has been in countries where the people are poor , Laos and Cuba and the Congo and Algeria and Iraq and Guatemala and all the rest .

political	1138	The peace requires that we have these adequate defenses - I know this Nation can afford them - and you know this Nation can not afford to be without them . Secondly , peace requires an America that is planning , preparing , and striving for disarmament and other steps toward peace . Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations .	unknown	Why , then , Mr. Khrushchev , have you decided to come ? It has been suggested that there are four possible reasons for your visit to the United States . First , it has been suggested that it is your objective to pose as a champion of disarmament .

political	1140	He made this motion to table at a time when we had unlimited time to consider the measure . These bills - housing , education , medical help , and minimum wage - are vitally important to millions of American - Negroes and whites because they affect all those Americans who are on the lower level of our economic ladder . I strongly support civil rights and I am wholeheartedly committed to the implementation of the platform , but to use civil rights at this time as a method of defeating other bills whose passage are also essential would have meant that the session would have ended in complete failure .	unknown	We were not as successful as I hoped we would be . But I think the real difficulty is the fact that on the two bills which were most controversial , the $ 1.25 minimum wage , and the aid to the aged and social security , we were informed in both cases that if those bills passed , the President would veto them . All the President has to do to stop action is to veto any bill and he needs , according to the Constitution , only one-third plus one of either body to sustain his veto .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	1141	Because , if any President - let 's assume Mr. Kennedy had been President had apologized to Mr. Khrushchev , Khrushchev , would have beaten him to a pulp , and we ca n't have a President doing that with Khrushchev or anybody else . And then in Cuba - again shooting from the hip - advocating a policy that would have broken our treaties , cost us our friends , gotten us probably , possibly certainly , into war . Of course , his defenders say he did n't mean it .	unknown	The President was right , right because no President can ever apologize for defending the security of the United States against surprise attack . And then , my friends , the third point you will recall if you heard our last debate , was on Cuba where he said the President was n't going far enough , and where he , in effect , advocated policies that were universally interpreted as meaning intervention in the affairs of Cuba . And what would that have meant ? It would have invited the very kind of intervention from abroad that could have brought war to this hemisphere and to the world .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1143	That 's what we 've been doing and that 's what we 're going to continue to do . It is n't as spectacular as President Eisenhower has done to go before the U.N. and to lay it on the line for controlled disarmament - not phony disarmament - not where you simply have empty pledges , but a case where both sides will disarm . Because remember this : If we ever have disarmament where we disarm and the other side does n't , that means that we increase the risk of war rather than reduce it , and we 're not going to do that and we can be sure of that .	unknown	Now , let 's turn to disarmament a moment . People say ,  Now , why is it we ca n't get some imaginative disarmament proposals , or suspension of nuclear test proposals ? Are n't we being too rigid ?  And I can only say I have seen these proposals over the years , and the United States could not have been more tolerant .

political	1144	Well , in eastern Kentucky the problem is comparable to the problem in West Virginia and the other States , where coal has brought in new machinery and automation has taken the jobs of men . I believe that the best program that we can put forward , as I suggested in my speech , was the so-called area redevelopment bill , which provides loans to small business , which provides loans and grants to communities to provide fresh water , which provides assistance for vocational retraining to train men for new jobs , loans for small businessmen at low rates of interest , supplemental unemployment compensation . The second program that I think would be useful is to restore defense manpower policy No.4, which provides that defense contracts shall be steered into those areas which have chronic amounts of surplus labor .	unknown	[ Applause . ] These problems of housing and social security , unemployment compensation , minimum wages , and the others fall into the general category of proposals put forward either in the administration of President Wilson or President Roosevelt , or President Truman . In that field , though in some ways it is a new problem , but an old one , I would include education because this country has been aiding education since the country began , since the Northwest Ordinance set aside one-sixteenth of the territory in order to help education , back when this country was founded , to the land grant colleges in 1862 , to the vocational aids , to the aids to impacted districts .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

On medical care for the aged tied to social security , which would cost 3 cents a day per person , an average of $ 12 a year it would insure any person retiring that they would receive medical care , nursing care , the cost of their medicine .

The fact of the matter is that every piece of major legislation which is the hallmark of Franklin Roosevelt 's administration from social security to minimum wage , from the Securities and Exchange Act to TVA , every one of those pieces of legislation was opposed - at the time they were written - by the Republican Party . They say our goals are the same .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage

political	1176	The administration was not concerned about the problem of providing for free elections and democracy in all of Latin America and sooner or later dictatorships lead to control of the national movement by the Communists . It happened in Iraq , it happened in Cuba , it will happen any place . Anyone who feels that you can do business with a dictator year after year because he is going to vote with you in the United Nations , sooner or later the Communists will gather control of the opposition movement and when he goes they will seize control .	unknown	Three countries of Africa , newly independent in the last 2 years , have begun to move in the direction of the Communists .

Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing .

Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished . Ninety percent of the Republicans could vote against 25 cents an hour in 1935 just as they voted against $ 1.25 minimium wage in 1960 .	unknown	Put your thumb down regardless of what you do .

So , if we 're not going to have a recession , how about our programs for progress for the future ? Well , here , as you might expect , the voter again is confronted with a real problem , because I say that I have programs that will produce progress , better schools and better housing for all Americans , a program of medical care for the aged , a program that will expand job opportunities for all of our people ; a program in the field of civil rights that sees that all Americans move forward together , leaving none behind . My opponent , of course , has programs in these same fields , and , so , here again you have the predicament .	unknown	A further Federal - State program should be inaugurated at once , designed to help rehabilitate handicapped persons who may never again be able to accept regular employment but who can be brought to the point where they need not be dependent on custodial care . Many older people in hospitals and nursing homes today could care for themselves in the proper setting , if the combined forces of medical care , social service counseling , and other resources were brought to bear on their handicaps . Additional Federal funds should be made available for research and training in the field of rehabilitation , with special emphasis on rehabilitation of older people .	unknown	support	medical care,health care
political	1181	[ Response from the audience . ] I want someone to tell me a single piece of domestic legislation that Mr. Nixon ever proposed that stood for progress for the people , from minimum wage , social security - this summer we tried to pass a bill for medical care for the older citizens . Under the bill , which the President signed , before you or your mother and father , who may be retired , who may have a heart attack or cancer or sick for several months - before they can get any assistance under that program , they first have to sign a petition that they are medically indigent .	unknown	The real question for our time is : Can we make a free society develop , grow , thrive , with sufficient purpose , sufficient direction , to compete with the single-minded advance of the Communists over a long period of time ? That is the problem that all of us face as Republicans and Democrats . My disagreement with this administration is that it has not set our goals high enough , that it has not provided the means and the mechanism by which we can meet the problems that we face , whether it is education whether it is housing , whether it is medical care for our older citizens , whether it is employment for our people , whether it is the development of natural resources , whether it is the building of strength throughout the world . Today , Latin America , Africa , and Asia hang on the razor edge of decision to decide which road they will take .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	1182	Do we want that from our President ? No. Our President goes before the United Nations . He comes out with an honest program of disarmament . Not one which is naive , because , as the President says , America must never disarm unless we have guarantees that the Khrushchevs and the others will also reduce their armaments at the same time .	unknown	He does n't give you something in return for it . He gets contempt for you , and he stomps on you , and , may I say , that if I have the opportunity to lead this country , we will always go the extra miles , negotiate differences ; we will always stand for peace ; we will always work for disarmament under proper inspection , but under no circumstances , when we 're doing something which is right , and that is defending the security of this country , will I apologize for the United States of America to anybody .

What we suggest is that medical care for the aged be tied to social security , every working American contribute , and it 's little less than 3 cents a day during their working years . Then when they 're retired , they can draw on this fund and they can sustain themselves and meet their responsibilities .	unknown	We have a social security system , but it pays the 16 million Americans who live over the age of 65 , it pays them an average social security check of less than $ 72 a month . I believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security must be passed by the next Congress . [ Applause .	unknown	support	medical care,health care

There are many kinds of waste , and I think it is the function of government to use our resources to the fullest , to use our natural and material and human resources to the fullest , to educate our children , to build a stronger economy , to provide medical care for our aged under social security , to use to the fullest those areas of the United States where unemployment has been chronic for a great many years , to use our brains and our energy to build a stronger and better society here in the United States . I think the future is ging to be a difficult one for us , but I have the greatest confidence in this country .	unknown	Here the Wabash and Ohio Rivers drain the heartland of America , an area rich in resources , an area ideally located to serve the markets of the Midwest , and an area with a skilled , determined and vigorous people . But in the past 8 years the Republican Party has transformed this potential wealth , this Valley of Opportunity , into a Valley of Lost Opportunity , a valley of increasing unemployment , and mounting poverty , a valley of decreasing income and lost jobs .

We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ? It means higher prices , higher taxes for the American people .	unknown	Thank you .

Well , if you want experience which consists of opposition to basic programs , programs of $ 1.25 minimum wage , programs of housing , programs of industrial growth , programs of strength , programs of peace , then experience does count . I have been in the Congress for 14 years .	unknown	Franklin Roosevelt proposed a 25-cent minimum wage , back in the middle thirties ; 90 percent of the Republicans voted against it . We proposed this summer a minimum wage of $ 1.25 and 90 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives voted against it .

One of the reasons we have been unable to secure an effective disarmament policy in outer space was because the Soviet Union was ahead of us and they said they would not agree to any disarmament of outer space unless we also abandoned our bases overseas , because they said they would be giving up their lead .

Other Republicans attacked minimum wage as  communism  and the  road to economic hell  - 93 percent of the Republicans in Congress voted to kill the bill calling for a 25-cent minimum wage and the Republicans have opposed every increase in the minimum wage ever since . Today the Social Security Act is regarded as the most important and beneficial single piece of social legislation in American history .	unknown	Mr. Nixon represents a party which has opposed progress - for many years . He represents a party which voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties , and voted 90 percent against $ 1.25 minimum wage in 1960 . He represents a party which has opposed the strengthening of our educational system , which has opposed medical care for our older citizens tied to social security , which has brought recession in 1954 , again in 1958 , and has brought us to an economic slowdown in the vital year of 1960 .	unknown	support	minimum wage

We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	unknown	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react .

Well , if we are all for the same goals , why did the Republicans defeat our efforts to provide a minimum wage of $ 1.25 , and medical care for our aged citizens , and Federal aid to education , and housing to rebuild our cities ? Our goals are not the same , nor are the means the same , nor have they been since Theodore Roosevelt . A Democratic Party sees the government and the people working together for a stronger and better country , for , in Paul Douglas ' words , a juster America .	unknown	Can you tell me anything more wasteful than that ? So the minimum wage does not cost anything . Medical care for the aged is financed under social security . Far more wasteful is the bill which was finally passed which would cost $ 2 billion a year , $ 1 billion by the Federal Government out of the Treasury , and $ 1 billion by the States , and before anybody gets any assistance they have to take a pauper 's oath before they can get any assistance , if they are over 65 .	unknown	support	medical care,health care

My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America , our needs in Africa , our needs in Asia , our needs in disarmament , our needs in arms , because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality , curiosity , foresight , and vigor . [ Applause .	unknown	We can not parley on the basis of equality with the Soviet unless we maintain a military position of equality with them , and that goes in the traditional weapons and in missiles and in outer space .

But I do think that in the final analysis that the President should make a judgment as to whether he should attend the United Nations .	unknown	Well , let me say that in the first place I think his purpose in coming here could be manifold . First , he may have some new proposals on disarmament which he hopes to capture the attention of the world with . Second I think he thinks that the General Assembly of the United Nations is going to be increasingly influential and powerful .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	1201	History disproved them . On each of these three occasions increases for sharper than those we propose today were put into effect without injury to employees , inflation , or unemployment . The fancied dangers were never realized .	unknown	The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration . Our unemployment benefits , too , must be standardized and extended .

I am not satisfied to have the largest shopping center as long as the Soviet Union is moving in Latin America , Asia , and Cuba . I think we can do better ; that is the question before us in 1960 .	unknown	We must be strong in purpose , we must be strong in leadership , we must be strong militarily , and we must be strong economically . It is no accident that the Communists have made their greatest gains from Laos to Cuba to Africa , during the period when our relative strength was in decline , when 1 out of every 16 Americans is unemployed , when 1 out of 20 who is employed is forced to work part time , when great industries like steel are barely working half of their capacity , when , for 7 years , our farmers have been caught in a cruel squeeze between ever-increasing rises in their costs and a decline in their prices , which has caused them to be the most oppressed group in the American economy , when mining is depressed , when lumber production is double and transportation is down , and the cost of living goes up .

I would feel both of those , plus the coal research bill , plus the national fuels policy , I believe all of those would be of assistance in eastern Kentucky and these other hard-hit areas .	unknown	There are a billion more people crowding our globe , and every American can hear the rumbling of a distant drum .

Kennedy tonight expressed keen disappointment on the defeat of the Anderson - Kennedy amendment to the medical care to the aged bill .  I am sure that the threat of a White House veto mentioned by every speaker opposing the amendment contributed to this defeat .	unknown	From now until November 8 we are taking our ease to the forum in which it belongs , where there is no threat of veto , where there is no parliamentary obstruction , and where we will be successful - and that is the forum of the American people . Until a Democrat is in the White house , the Republicans can block action on an adequate minimum wage , they can water down medical care for the aged , they can play politics with civil rights , they can block action on a decent housing bill and a good school bill . But they can not block the American people on November 8.

Why do n't we send the Marines in ? My friends , the reason we do n't is that we do n't want to make a second Hungary out of 5 million people on the island of Cuba . The reason we do n't is that we know the people of Cuba will take care of this or any other dictator in their good time if they get the moral support of the United States . So , the President said : We will quarantine Castro .	unknown	And then my opponent said : Oh , this is too little ; this is too late - and , shooting from the hip , but missing the mark , as he so often has done [ cheers and applause ] - what he did was - he shot from the hip , and he said - this is too little and too late .

We want to be sure that we do n't put our doctors , for example , on the Federal payroll .	unknown	We want to move forward as this district has moved forward .

Workers in many important industrial communities have been still more seriously injured .	unknown	But in our effort to create a growing America - an America which will someday provide a job for every man who wants to work - we must not forget about those who are out of work today .

We need to offer a richer and more varied diet to those forced to live on surplus foods .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive forces of armaments may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament - into great multi-Nation efforts to eradicate disease , harness rivers , eliminate illiteracy , and exploit the frontiers of space . We want a peace in which we can truly beat our swords into plowshares , our bombs into reactors , and our rockets into vehicles for exploring outer space .	unknown	I believe that this country can do more for peace than it has done . I am not satisfied to have only 100 experts scattered through the U.S. Government working on the sensitive and complex issue of disarmament . I regret that our negotiators at previous disarmament conferences too often have been ill prepared , ill advised , and ill staffed .	unknown	support	disarmament

All I can say is this : On three great issues - the Formosa Straits , the President 's conduct at the summit conference , when he refused to apologize to Khrushchev , as he should have refused to apologize to him --- [ Cheers and applause . ] And then on Cuba - Senator Kennedy has said one thing , President Eisenhower has said another - President Eisenhower has been right , Senator Kennedy has been wrong - and the American people know it . [ Cheers and applause .	unknown	Here again we see the President taking the line that we will quarantine Castro , and we 're doing it economically and politically , and that will have the effect that everybody wants to see , that the Cuban people have the opportunity to have freedom . And yet here again my opponent made a suggestion which throughout the world , in every paper supporting him in this campaign , even in the United States , was interpreted as meaning advocating Government intervention in Cuba . What would that have meant ? It would have meant an open invitation for civil war , an open invitation for the Communists to come in. But then others say to me ,  But , Mr. Nixon , he did n't mean it .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1215	But the hard facts of the matter are that we have fewer than 100 people in the entire Federal Government working on these problems . And the result has been that this country has not been prepared for any disarmament , arms control or atomic testing conference that has taken place since the end of the Korean war . I have proposed in the Congress the establishment of a National Peace Agency - an Arms Control Research Institute - and the next President of the United States must take this step to pave the way for peace .	unknown	The next President must promptly send to the Congress a special message requesting the funds and the authority necessary to give us a nuclear capacity second to none , making us invulnerable to any attack , and have conventional forces so strong and so mobile that they can stamp out a brush fire war before it spreads .

The failure of corporate profits to rise and the consequent loss of expected corporate tax collections has caused a substantial change in the budget picture .	unknown	And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1217	But the burden which should concern us most lies upon the American conscience . We can no longer tolerate growing patches of poverty and injustice in America - substandard wages , unemployment , city slums , inadequate medical care , inferior education and the sad plight of migratory workers . The enactment of this bill is only one step , but an essential step forward , as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation .	unknown	And behind the statistics are people . I have seen in West Virginia and Pennsylvania what unemployment means . It means hungry children - families unable to afford decent clothes or a decent home to live in. Let us face facts : We will not have full employment and rapid economic growth in America without positive policies to get it .	unknown	support	unemployment
political	1218	I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	unknown	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	1220	First , those of you who are active in labor , those of you who lead organized labor movements , are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public , and you know very well , perhaps better than anyone , that this country still has unfinished business , that we have to maintain full employment , that we have to advance the standards of living of our people , of better housing , of better minimum wage , of medical care for the aged . Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished . Ninety percent of the Republicans could vote against 25 cents an hour in 1935 just as they voted against $ 1.25 minimium wage in 1960 .	unknown	This summer , when we tried to improve the standards of social security by providing medical care for the aged tied to social security , again the great majority of the Republicans , over 90 percent , voted against medical care for the aged tied to social security . Eighty percent of the members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week for an industry , a business , that makes more than a million dollars a year . How can anybody live on it ? No Member of the Congress could .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	1223	In other words , the Federal Government will loan its credit to businesses that wish to come to areas such as this , will provide vocational retraining for older workers , provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for those who are out of work for a long time , will aid in cleansing the rivers , will aid in trying to bring new industry into this area . We will , if we pass defense manpower policy No.4 again , steer defense contracts into those areas with a high level of unemployment . 2. I think the President and the administration and the Government and the State government and the city should join together in cleaning our polluted rivers .	unknown	That may have been all right in those times when we had full employment . Farmers could farm and work in the cities and towns , but this year we have the highest unemployment that we have had in any months of August and September , the three Augusts and Septembers preceding the recession of 1949 , 1954 , and 1958 , and this district knows this problem well , because this district has lost 60,000 people in the last 10 years . The failure of this administration to support the area redevelopment bill which has passed the U.S. Senate three times , introduced in the Senate by Senator Douglas , supported strongly by your Congressman , I think has made it more difficult for this district and districts in my own State of Massachusetts and in West Virginia and in Pennsylvania and in Kentucky , to lift themselves off the ground .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

The enactment of this bill is only one step , but an essential step forward , as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation .	unknown	The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration . Our unemployment benefits , too , must be standardized and extended . By assuring working Americans of a living wage , by assuring unemployed Americans that they will be able to have the basic necessities of life , we help not only New England against substandard competition ; we help the entire Nation .	unknown	support	unemployment
political	1225	It does not depend upon the uncertainties of financing from general revenues . I feel strongly that there must be no means test in providing medical care insurance . Already 2 1/4 million of our older citizens must rely on public assistance for their daily needs .	unknown	As I said , we did secure the passage in the Senate of the minimum wage 2 to 1 , which was a bill that I sponsored . We missed on medical care for the aged in the Senate only by five votes . We missed passing $ 1.25 an hour minimum wage in the House .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	1226	The generation for which I speak has seen enough of warmongers - let our great role in history be that of peacemakers . But the harsh facts of the matter are that in three vital areas we have been ill-staffed and ill-represented in the struggle for peace - in our disarmament planning , in our diplomatic and foreign service , and in our technical assistance to underdeveloped nations . In all three areas , we have failed to realize that times have changed since World War II .	unknown	Such an effort requires not only long-term development loans but education , student exchanges , stepped up Voice of America broadcasts , concerned and competent Ambassadors , and a wide range of measures designed to increase the strength of freedom and stimulate the economic advance on which freedom often depends . Fourth , we will strengthen our planning the preparation for disarmament . One of the most glaring failures of the past 8 years has been our failure to prepare properly for any arms control conference since the end of the Korean war .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	1227	This is another case of your speaking first and thinking afterward - a habit which is a very dangerous one for a man who is asking the American people to select him as Commander in Chief of all the Armed Forces of this Nation . If your original statement on Cuba had been intended only to cover what you now claim in your telegram to the effect that we should  let the forces of freedom in Cuba know that we believe that freedom will again arise in their country  you would have been advocating what has been the policy which the administration has been following for months . Apparently you are under the impression that when attention is called to your mistakes you can confuse people by immediately claiming that you were misquoted or that what you said was distorted .	unknown	This was :  Senator Kennedy has a quick mind , but I would say that he might tend to arrive at judgments almost too quickly .  You remember what he said about Cuba . If he had said that when he was President of the United States , the trouble that would have been caused simply could n't be imagined .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1229	This was too little and too late . He said the Government of the United States should support the anti-Castro forces in and out of Cuba - and again I quote him exactly - and again he was wrong and the President was right , because what my opponent would have done would have violated five treaties . It caused dismay and concern among our allies throughout the world .	unknown	He indicates now that he did n't really mean that the President should have apologized . He was only talking about it theoretically , and he indicates now that he did n't really mean that the Federal Government should intervene in Cuba . He was only talking about what we 're already doing , as a matter of fact , giving moral support to the cause of freedom in Cuba and all around the world .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1230	I agree , and I also feel very strongly that we must set a good example of democracy at home if we are to be the leaders of the free world and enjoy the friendship and respect of the people . Many women are concerned with the failure of disarmament negotiations . Mrs. Angela Bambacci of Baltimore , Md .	unknown	One of the most glaring failures of the past 8 years has been our failure to prepare properly for any arms control conference since the end of the Korean war . As a result we have allowed the Soviet Union to take the initiative and win the propaganda victories while our blunder often made it seem to others that America , not Russia , was the real obstacle to disarmament . It is no longer enough to have only 100 men , in the entire Government , working on the complex problem of arms control .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1231	Sixth , we must revise our outmoded unemployment compensation laws to allow men to receive full benefit payments while they are engaged in retraining programs . Seventh and finally , we must restore full employment to our schedule of national priorities - striving - for a more rapid growth of the American economy - building purchasing power through better minimum wage and unemployment compensation laws - having faith in America 's capacity to eventually provide a productive job for every man who wants to work . This is our program - a program which can help transform the threat of automation into the promise of abundance - a program which will require leadership inspired by both compassion and courage - a program which will require from labor , management , and Government a willingness to accept new concepts , new burdens and new risks to meet the challenge of automation 's new frontier .	unknown	Franklin Roosevelt once reminded us that  we can not be content * * * if some fraction of our people - whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth - is ill-fed , ill-clothed , ill-housed , and insecure .  But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1232	Sixth I have tried in this campaign to demonstrate my confidence in the American people , in their ability to listen to facts , not name calling , to judge the candidates on their own views , not someone else 's coat tails , to remember the records of the two parties , and not ignore party labels , to hear what is said in one section alone . It is because I have this confidence in you that I do not share my opponent 's fear of the future , his fears of every new program his fears that inflation and deficits and unemployment are unavoidable , his fear that we can not afford what we must afford , or even his fear of a fifth debate . In short , I have tried in this campaign to set forth my responsibilities - and yours as well .	unknown	Every piece of important legislation of benefit to our people was opposed by the Republicans when they first came into being , away back to the Federal Reserve Board , all the reforms of the Roosevelt administration , social security , all the others , minimum wage , housing , benefits to the farmers , all opposed . Now , with that long history , TVA , the development of our resources , all in opposition , with that long history , how can we expect that that party and that candidate can move this country ahead , with all the changes coming on , the prospects for unemployment , the recession possibly this winter in 1961 , with our farm income down 25 percent , with 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never seeing the inside of a college , who graduate from high school , our prestige in the world being affected , with Communists on the march , Castro on the march . I believe the United States has to make a decision .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1233	But in 8 short years that bright heritage , the heritage of 20 Democratic years , has been largely dissipated and destroyed , and much of the good will , which it took two decades to build , has been lost . In Cuba the Communists have gained a satellite and established a base for the attempted infiltration and subversion of all Latin America . In Venezuela angry mobs have assaulted the Vice President of the United States .	unknown	Yet we have done almost nothing to keep Castro from consolidating his regime and beginning subversive activities throughout Latin America . In fact , our prestige in Latin America has fallen so low that - at the recent Inter - American Foreign Ministers Conference - we were unable to persuade our former good neighbors to pass a resolution even criticizing Cuba by name . Now , 2 years later , following blunder after blunder , defeat after defeat , the Republicans decide to combat communism by cutting off exports long after the time has passed when such a move might have had a really significant impact - long after our Cuban exports have declined drastically - and long after , as Mr. Nixon must privately recognize , Mr. Castro himself had already embarked on a deliberate program to cut down American exports .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1234	History disproved them . On each of these three occasions increases for sharper than those we propose today were put into effect without injury to employees , inflation , or unemployment . The fancied dangers were never realized .	unknown	But from my trip on that occasion and from my information as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , it seems to me that there are three areas where the United States should strengthen itself , and I think this city has a particular role to play in that strengthening . If you have unemployment here , it is not only citizens who want a job who ca n't find work ; there are some of the most highly skilled people in the United States whose skills as a team and as individuals could be dissipated . Therefore , I think the United States should make a greater effort in the field of missiles , first ; secondly , it should do a greater job and a better job in the field of developing an airlift capacity - nearly all the planes that took the U.N. forces to the Congo were American planes , but most of them were planes which are becoming obsolete and they contrasted in some cases to the jets which the Russians and the British used for transportation of U.N. personnel - and thirdly , I think that we should strengthen our retaliatory capacity , the traditional manned bomber , unless the United States is prepared to give up the lead in this vital form of national defense and national security .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1235	Farmers will manage their own production , will limit their own marketing through such devices as marketing quotas , marketing orders and agreements , Government purchases , crop loans , and so on - an individual farmer-managed program tailored to each individual crop . With the price of milk fat today at only 80 percent of parity , the labor earnings of dairy farmers are less than the national minimum wage . Governor Nelson has taken an active role in formulating a dairy program .	unknown	Can you tell me what , in the last 25 years , what program the Republican leadership ever suggested that served the people ? [ Response from the audience . ] Housing legislation and social security ? Minimum wage ? All of the programs that serve our people , that advance our country , that provide this country with vigor and vitality , education , security for our aged citizens under medical care under social security , all these programs have been initiated by the party which we lead in this campaign . And as you look at the sixties and recognize the need for new resolutions to new problems , I ca n't believe that this country will entrust the leadership to a candidate and a party that have opposed progress in the last 25 years .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	1236	I believe that we can divide , generally , the responsibilities which we will meet in the sixties into two categories . The first of those is to attempt to bring up to date those pieces of social legislation passed in the 1930 's which still have great significance in the lives of our citizens today , and , therefore , while Franklin Roosevelt could propose in 1935 a 25-cent minimum wage , we proposed in 1960 a $ 1.25 minimum wage . Where Franklin Roosevelt proposed social security in 1935 , we propose in 1960 medical care for the aged tied to social security .	unknown	When income goes down and the cost of living goes up , who is hit the hardest ? 1. Next to those who ca n't find any work at all , those on an inadequate unemployment compensation or public assistance payment , the hardest hit by the job-price squeeze are those Americans who are forced to work for substandard wages . This year the Democratic Party tried to raise the minimum wage to $ 1.25 an hour , to $ 50 for a 48-hour week . Mr. Nixon opposed this measure .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	1238	But from my trip on that occasion and from my information as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , it seems to me that there are three areas where the United States should strengthen itself , and I think this city has a particular role to play in that strengthening . If you have unemployment here , it is not only citizens who want a job who ca n't find work ; there are some of the most highly skilled people in the United States whose skills as a team and as individuals could be dissipated . Therefore , I think the United States should make a greater effort in the field of missiles , first ; secondly , it should do a greater job and a better job in the field of developing an airlift capacity - nearly all the planes that took the U.N. forces to the Congo were American planes , but most of them were planes which are becoming obsolete and they contrasted in some cases to the jets which the Russians and the British used for transportation of U.N. personnel - and thirdly , I think that we should strengthen our retaliatory capacity , the traditional manned bomber , unless the United States is prepared to give up the lead in this vital form of national defense and national security .	unknown	And in both 1958 and 1959 , an average of more than 1 million idle workers remained out of a job for more than 15 weeks - the highest number since before the war . These figures tell a human story - the story of unemployment benefits running out - of 3 million Americans forced to live on an unhealthy tasteless diet of surplus foods - a story of hardship and personal tragedy . What , then , does Mr. Nixon mean when he says we are enjoying the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed ? Perhaps he believes that if only 1 out of every 10 Americans are unable to find full-time work , the other 9 out of every 10 must be doing all right .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1240	This year again the Republican Party - as it always has in the past - is fighting every single Democratic effort to advance the welfare of our people to relieve poverty and hunger and the burdens of illness . This year again only a single Republican in the Senate voted for medical care for the aged . This year again Mr. Nixon , as the spokesman for his party , speaking to 73 million people in our television debate , said that our efforts to provide medical care through social security were  extreme .	unknown	But our goals are not the same . I want a $ 1.25 an hour minimum wage , medical care for the aged through social security , Federal aid to help raise teachers salaries as well as schools , an adequate program of slum clearance and low-rent housing , and a program of aid to areas of chronic unemployment which would include northern Minnesota . These are my goals .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	1241	I think that you know the issues of this campaign well . There is no community in the United States in the last 2 or 3 years that has learned a harder lesson of what it means to live under a Republican administration [ applause ] and an administration which has permitted unemployment in this community to double in the last 12 months . [ Response from the audience .	unknown	[ Applause . ] On television this afternoon he repeated one of the oldest , tiredest stories of the Republicans , that $ 1.25 minimum wage would cause massive unemployment . That is the same old story that they used to tell in the thirties when the Democrats and Franklin Roosevelt first wrote in a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1242	Now he says he really did n't mean it that way . He disagreed with the President on Cuba , but now he says his position is really about the same as the President 's . Over and over again , we find him saying one thing one day and another thing another day , as soon as he reads the polls or hears the people .	unknown	As a matter of fact , my friends , on every one of these three instances his friends and supporters say : But , Mr. Nixon , he changed his mind . He 's now for the President on Cuba . He now says that the President did the right thing in Paris .	unknown	support	cuba
political	1243	Put your thumb down regardless of what you do . We are fighting a candidate , the Republican Party , that for 20 years has opposed what the people need , minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation . The real issue is which party and which candidate can best strengthen the United States , can best serve the public interest .	unknown	The third point on which we differ is in the record of our party , and the promise that that record gives to the future . Ninety percent of the Republicans voted against a 25-cent minimum wage in 1935 , and 90 percent of them voted against the $ 1.25 an hour in 1960 , which Mr. Nixon considers extreme . Ninety percent of the Republicans voted against the social security in the midthirties and 95 percent in 1960 voted against the medical care for the aged tied to social security .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	1244	It is true , as you stated in your telegram , that I said that I intended to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . When I said that I had no idea that you would make even a greater blunder about Cuba . Consequently , I will talk about not only Quemoy and Matsu but also about Cuba every day during the next 2 weeks - I will do this because I am deeply concerned about the policies you advocate in those two areas of the world which might well lead to abandoning free territory in the Far East , and a loss of all of our Latin American allies in this hemisphere or worse .	unknown	We have participated in the discussions leading to these great decisions , and as far as the record is concerned , we are part of it ; we are proud of it , and I think that the American people know what we will do when a crisis comes . As far as our opponent is concerned , I would only suggest this : We have a pretty good idea what he would do , too , and , based on what he has said in this campaign , how he disagreed with the President on Quemoy and Matsu , how he suggested that the President could have apologized to Khrushchev at Paris , is almost certainly the most irresponsible proposal ever advocated by a Presidential candidate with regard to Cuba - when you consider these things , I say that we can not afford the inexperience of a man like that as President of the United States . And , of course , some people may well say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , he 's changed his mind about Quemoy and Matsu .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1245	But the unpleasant facts are still there . And I can assure you that if Mr. Nixon can travel across this great land and remain indifferent to the problems of unemployment and economic slow-down which afflict many sections of America - problems which he is seeing at first hand - his vision will be no clearer and his awareness no greater from the White House in far-away Washington . For the Mr. Nixon who can look upon your distress - and say all is well - is the same Mr. Nixon who , in the past 8 years , has led the fight against every Democratic measure designed to increase the welfare of the American people - to put men back to work - and to help rebuild the economically distressed areas of America .	unknown	This revolution in nationhood has been but one of several other revolutions , all of which have been going on at the same time - and all of tremendous importance to history . There is the revolution in transportation and communication which is shrinking our world with every passing day ; there is the revolution in medicine which is enabling human beings to become healthier and live longer ; the revolution in automation , which increases our abundance , but also our unemployment ; the revolution of farm production , which could bring the eventual elimination of hunger in the world , but which so far has only brought disaster to the farm family ; the revolution of our exploding urban population which brings with it the problems of overerowded schools , urban blight , and crowded slums . There is the revolution in education , which sees more and more of our young people going to college , while two-thirds of the world 's population still remains illiterate ; the tremendously exciting revolution in space , which will soon carry man to other worlds undreamed of ; and the equally exciting and morally refreshing revolution for human rights for all citizens here at home .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1246	In other words , maintaining a position of equality permits you to negotiate more successfully . It is a source of concern to me that this Government has had less than 100 people scattered through the entire Federal Government working on the subject of disarmament . I would put more people into it .	unknown	The negotiations on nuclear testing are as far apart as ever . The talks on disarmament have been called off .

There is not any doubt we had great influence in Cuba , and I think it is unfortunate that we did not use that influence more vigorously to persuade Mr. Batista to hold free , open elections , so that the people of Cuba could have made the choice , rather than holding onto his power and finally driven out by Castro at the point of a gun . Mr. Castro is now a Communist .	unknown	[ Applause . ] I have asked Mr. Nixon to participate in a fifth debate which I think should cover the question of Cuba and other important problems facing the American people .

I know the American labor movement opposes what I oppose : complacency , unemployment , economic stagnation , racial discrimination , and national insecurity .	unknown	Franklin Roosevelt once reminded us that  we can not be content * * * if some fraction of our people - whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth - is ill-fed , ill-clothed , ill-housed , and insecure .

political	1250	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	unknown	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	unknown	support	disarmament

This clearly means , as the New York Times Washington correspondent , James Reston , reported in today 's paper :  His statement this week on Cuba , publicly calling for Government aid to overthrow Castro , is a clear violation of the inter-American treaty prohibition against intervention in the internal affairs of the hemisphere Republics .

Well , it is n't really self-imposed .	unknown	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .	unknown	support	disarmament

My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America , our needs in Africa , our needs in Asia , our needs in disarmament , our needs in arms , because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality , curiosity , foresight , and vigor .

As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament .

political	1267	I want to make it very clear that the differences between Mr. Nixon and myself , the differences between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are clear . Mr. Nixon represents a party , a philosophy which he believes in , which voted against social security and minimum wage and housing and unemployment compensation . The fact of the matter is that the Republican Party controlled the Congress and the Presidency for years and no civil rights bill ever saw the light of day .	unknown	We are going to have to build a better life for our people . As long as there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , as long as there are millions of Americans who are not even paid a dollar an hour , as long as there are hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work , living on an average unemployment compensation check of $ 31 a week - what do they do when they go out of a job ? Where do they go to work ? How do they keep their families ? How do they pay their rent ? These are the problems that disturb America . How do we maintain our position in the world ? How do we provide fairness and equality of opportunity for all Americans ? I think that on Tuesday my job and responsibility and that of Mr. Nixon 's is over .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1268	This fast-moving technological revolution offers hope of vastly increased productivity - of greater abundance for all Americans . But we must harness it to serve the welfare of our people and not allow it to become an instrument of economic distress and unemployment . In the past 8 years nothing has been done to meet this growing challenge .	unknown	First , we must spur the rate of national economic growth so as to take up the slack now existing in heavy industry - such as steel , chemicals , and autos - and in service industries - such as building and construction . Secondly , we must administer existing defense and other Federal procurement programs in a manner that , consistent with the national interest , areas with idle facilities and idle skills are given priority before those skills are disgraced and chronic unemployment takes over . Third , to that end , we will repass , and I would sign , the depressed-areas bill twice vetoed by the Republicans .	unknown	support	unemployment
political	1269	Nevertheless , we must recognize that the textile and apparel industries are of international scope and are peculiarly susceptible to competitive pressure from imports . Clearly the problems of the industry will not disappear by neglect nor can we wait for a large scale unemployment and shutdown of the industry to inspire us to action . A comprehensive industrywide remedy is necessary .	unknown	Throughout the entire Nation men and women - almost 4 million of them - are looking for jobs . Economists tell us that an unemployment rate of 6 percent is the danger signal .

political	1270	I urge the President to act now . The intentions of the Republicans today was to use civil rights legislation to block the enactment of bills for Federal-aid to education , housing , medical assistance to the aged and the lifting of the minimum wage . The evidence lies in the fact that it was Senator Dirksen himself last April 1 who moved to table the very Government Contracts Commission proposal which he now purports to support .	unknown	No.2, we went to conference between the House and the Senate on minimum wage . Six out of seven Republicans on that conference voted against that not only the $ 1.25 minimum wage , but also against the President 's own program which we finally offered as a compromise . Six out of seven Democrats on the conference voted for the $ 1.25 minimum wage .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	1271	I do n't think the monetary and fiscal policies which this administration has followed are good enough . I believe that when they stand against the minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , I think they are standing in the way of progress . We have high interest rates and as a partial result we built this year 200,000 less homes than we needed in this country to stay up with our population .	unknown	And it was extreme for Mr. Nixon . For he had previously voted to completely remove 1 million workers from the protection of the minimum wage laws and he is the candidate of a party which opposed the first 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage and which has fought against every increase since . 2.

political	1272	Well , it is , Jackie , of course , the great problem . And I really do n't think that we 've made enough progress , for example , in the area of disarmament in the last years . We 've only had about 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament , the subject of nuclear testing .	unknown	The catastrophic arms race , more costly than all of our budget put together , more costly than all the other things which we pay for , can not be eliminated merely by wishful thinking . But is n't it a somber fact that this administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire National Government on the subject of disarmament One-fifth as many as work for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission are working on disarmament in this administration - 100 people scattered throughout the international government .

Thus , there may be two employees , working side by side in the employ of the same employer , one of whom is protected by the statutory minimum wage and one who is not .

As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	unknown	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	unknown	support	disarmament

We supported the legislation recommended by the administration .	unknown	A Republican candidate and a Republican President , representing as he does those interests and members of the Republican Party , must take a particular position on a particular issue . Is it any accident that for the last 25 years the Republicans have voted against the minimum wage nearly every time ? They voted against the 25 cents in 1935 , and they voted against the $ 1.25 in 1960 .

The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people .

political	1280	 What are the folks going to do ? What are the voters going to do ? Here 's what you do : First , you look at our record and on the record I say you compare the record of the Eisenhower administration with the record of the administration which preceded it . Both have been in for 7 ½ years , and you can take any test you want - schools , housing , medical care , jobs , wages , controlling inflation - and you will find that in this administration we have moved forward ; we have had far greater progress than in the Truman administration . And , so , your choice is : If you want to go back to what we left , you have an easy choice because that 's what our opponents offer .	unknown	And what about that future ? We want a future of progress , but above all , the people of this country are concerned that our children may grow up in a world in which we can be free and we can live at peace - and that is the most important thing that Americans must think about at this time . Now , obviously , I know people could say ,  Well , now , just a minute , Mr. Nixon , do you mean that peace and developing policies that will keep peace and freedom are more important that jobs , more important than good medical care and more important than housing and education and the like ?  And the answer is that of course all those things are important too . But we can have all those things and it wo n't do us any good if we 're not around to enjoy them .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

[ Applause .	unknown	And in both 1958 and 1959 , an average of more than 1 million idle workers remained out of a job for more than 15 week - the highest number since before the war . These figures tell a human story - the story of unemployment benefits running out - of 3 million Americans force to live on an unhealthy , tasteless diet of surplus foods - a story of hardship and personal tragedy . What , then , does Mr. Nixon mean when he says we are enjoying the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed ?

This month Mr. Nixon promises you medical care for our older citizens . But last August Mr. Nixon directed the opposition to a Democratic bill , which would have provided medical care for the aged under social security .	unknown	We can take action to provide aid to education .

political	1300	Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations . A successful blueprint for a safe disarmament is as difficult to devise as a successful blueprint for modern war . But the hard facts of the matter are that we have fewer than 100 people in the entire Federal Government working on these problems .	unknown	Well , let me say that in the first place I think his purpose in coming here could be manifold .

Second I think he thinks that the General Assembly of the United Nations is going to be increasingly influential and powerful .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1301	I have no doubt that the men of little faith who lead the Republican Party will criticize this goal as utopian and unrealistic . Such criticism comes easily to a party whose candidate has said that  unemployment is inevitable  - a party which has allowed the unemployment rate to soar to 5.7 percent - a party which has presided over a continual decline in our rate of economic growth . But such criticism will not halt our efforts .	unknown	[ Applause . ] Franklin D.

political	1304	I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	unknown	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	unknown	support	disarmament

They are the efforts which Democratic Presidents and Democratic Congresses have made to write into law a whole platform of social legislation , which permits all Americans to participate in our standard of living , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , housing , aid to education , medical care for the aged , all of the great litany of pieces of social legislation for which we are distinguished which make it easy for a Democratic candidate to run for the Presidency , and which Mr. Nixon 's party has opposed . It is our function , however , not to merely invoke the names of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman , not to merely live off what they did , but to bring these old programs up to date .	unknown	 Today the Fair Labor Standards Act , with its guarantee of a decent minimum wage , has become an established feature of the American economic System but in 1937 a leading Republican Congressman warned that  if you pass this bill * * * gone with the wind is our democratic system of government and all the institutions we hold dear .  Other Republicans attacked minimum wage as  communism  and the  road to economic hell  - 93 percent of the Republicans in Congress voted to kill the bill calling for a 25-cent minimum wage and the Republicans have opposed every increase in the minimum wage ever since . Today the Social Security Act is regarded as the most important and beneficial single piece of social legislation in American history .	unknown	support	minimum wage

This vote demonstrates that if we 're going to have effective legislation in this and other fields , we 're going to have to have an administration that will provide leadership and a Congress that will act .	unknown	This last session of the Congress for the last 4 weeks is a vivid example of what can happen when the country is divided in its leadership ; because the Republican Party opposed the $ 1.25 minimum wage , we did n't get it . Because the Republican Party - and only one Senator voted against them - opposed medical care for the aged tied to social security , which had the endorsement of Governor Rockefeller , as well as the Democratic Party , and it was beaten by five votes .

These are just some of the steps which we must take if we are to succeed in halting the steady advance of communism - an advance which is now on our very doorstep in Cuba . In the novel  On the Beach ,  the lone American survivors of world war III are standing on a beach in Australia , awaiting the inevitable end from the spreading cloud of radioactivity .	unknown	In 1955 Mr. Nixon went to Cuba to view conditions for himself . But his only reaction was to praise  the competence and stability  of the Batista dictatorship which was , even then , threatened by Communist activities - and to say that  communism has reached its high-water mark in Latin America  at a time when Communist influence was beginning to rise , and only a few short years before the Communists took over all of Cuba . Mr. Nixon saw nothing wrong in Cuba - he made no recommendations for action - he did not warn America that danger was growing - and as a result the Communists took over Cuba with virtually no opposition from the United States .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

We can no longer tolerate growing patches of poverty and injustice in America - substandard wages , unemployment , city slums , inadequate medical care , inferior education and the sad plight of migratory workers . The enactment of this bill is only one step , but an essential step forward , as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation .	unknown	To us the major issue is the fight against communism . But to most of the peoples of the world , that is a far-off battle - compared to their battles against poverty and disease and unemployment and illiteracy .

In cutting off a carefully limited number of the American goods which can be sent to Cuba Mr. Nixon has made a dramatic but almost empty gesture - a gesture which will have so little impact on Castro as to be almost meaningless . The State Department itself admits that our exports to Cuba have already declined by more than 50 percent since Castro took power .	unknown	unrelated	cuba

I believe that that program could be useful in using defense contracts most of which are not by bid but which are negotiated , to put those in areas where it is possible , where there is chronic unemployment and little hope for new industry . I would feel both of those , plus the coal research bill , plus the national fuels policy , I believe all of those would be of assistance in eastern Kentucky and these other hard-hit areas .	unknown	Last night , in our debate , Mr. Nixon was asked to give his program for economic growth - what he intended to do to put idle plants and idle men back to work - to move America toward new heights of production and strength - to provide new jobs for an expanding population . But Mr. Nixon had no new program , no new approach ; just the same old tired policies which have resulted in a doubling of unemployment and in a slowing down of our growth until , today , we are growing more slowly than every other industrial nation in the world - policies which have resulted in a steel industry operating at only 50 percent of capacity - an automobile industry which has laid off thousands of men - and a State of Michigan where more than 200,000 men are unemployed and which has never emerged from the Republican recession of 1958 . But the Democratic Party does have a program - a program which will reverse the downward trend of the past 8 years - which will put men back to work and move America toward new heights of productivity and abundance - which will build the stronger America on which the cause of freedom depends .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

What was the Security Council doing while the Nation was undergoing this experience ? Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina , Hungary , Suez , Sputnik , the riots in Venezuela , the collapse of the summit , the riots in Japan , the collapse of the Baghdad Pact , the failure of disarmament , the U-2 fiasco , and now Cuba and the Congo ? Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report , the Killian report , and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance : for  Atoms for Peace  was a slogan , the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce , the  open skies  plan was a gesture , and the Baghdad Pact was a failure . Mr. Nixon has presided , in short , over the decline of our national security .	unknown	We talked tough when communism began to grow in Cuba - but Cuba is a Communist satellite today .

My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America , our needs in Africa , our needs in Asia , our needs in disarmament , our needs in arms , because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality , curiosity , foresight , and vigor .

Now , if you regard those programs as extreme , I believe you should support Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party .	unknown	They stem from the administration of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman .

The United States in these critical times can not risk a President who makes mistakes of this magnitude .	unknown	So , I say to you : America should not take a chance on inexperienced leadership , however well intentioned it is , when you have experienced leadership that know these men and will deal with them effectively in the years ahead . And , now , if I may turn to one final point , and I mention this particularly to this group here , because there are some students here : Necessarily , in a campaign we have to discuss what we term the so-called hard issues in terms of foreign policy , specific issues like Cuba , Quemoy and Matsu , Lebanon , et cetera , and there is a tendency for Americans to forget the really important asset that we have in this great struggle in which we 're engaged .

And , my friends , whatever we may think about the costs of medical care - and they 're high , and they come particularly hard for families - not only older families , but younger ones as well - who have catastrophic illnesses , remember this : we 've got the best medical care in the world , and the reason it is is that our medical profession is free , that they are n't working for the Federal Government and I do n't want to reduce the standard of medical care .

The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people .

And more recently , in Cuba where he says that our policy of quarantining Mr. Castro is too little and too late , and where he advocated a policy which universally was interpreted as Government intervention in the affairs of that country , a policy which would have lost us every friend in Latin America , because it would have broken treaties with all of those countries , and a policy which , if carried out , would have invited war in this hemisphere , because certainly , if our Government had intervened , the Communists would have had a good excuse for coming in. Now , on all three of these points I recognize that Mr. Kennedy has said he has changed his mind , that he now supports the President on Quemoy and Matsu , that as far as Cuba is concerned , he did n't intend it to mean the way it sounded , and that in the field of the Paris Conference , that he agreed that the President , perhaps , conducted himself the right way under the circumstances ; but , my friends , that is n't enough .

I have confidence in an America able to afford the best schools and the best teachers in the world - an America where no one is denied his full constitutional rights by reason of his race or religion - an America where every family lives in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - an America where the cost of living is not completely beyond those who work for a living - particularly those receiving an inadequate minimum wage of $ 1 an hour .

There is the revolution in education , which sees more and more of our young people going to college , while two-thirds of the world 's population still remains illiterate ; the tremendously exciting revolution in space , which will soon carry man to other worlds undreamed of ; and the equally exciting and morally refreshing revolution for human rights for all citizens here at home .	unknown	They are still making those charges today .

We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	unknown	They want to go Eisenhower 's way - and that 's our way , and that 's the way we 're going . Now , the last point that I make is one that I make particularly because I know of the great concern the people in these university communities have for the cause of disarmament .

We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	unknown	We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament .

In the face of such power and determination we can not afford to falter or lag behind .	unknown	Guinea and Ghana have both moved in the direction of associating themselves with Soviet policy . Cuba is not the only example . What I am concerned about is in 1970 I do n't want to see independent country after independent country begin to move where Guinea and Ghana have gone , where the Congo almost went and may still go , where Cuba has already gone , because for a simple reason they feel that the Communists represent the future , they feel that we are identified with the past , they feel that we are identified with colonialism , they feel that we are identified with the kind of future which they do not want .	unknown	support	cuba
political	1413	Let me say , briefly , I believe there are two points . First , those of you who are active in labor , those of you who lead organized labor movements , are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public , and you know very well , perhaps better than anyone , that this country still has unfinished business , that we have to maintain full employment , that we have to advance the standards of living of our people , of better housing , of better minimum wage , of medical care for the aged . Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished .	unknown	Mr. Nixon made a speech 3 weeks ago about what we need to do in housing , and he said in that speech the Housing Act of 1949 works very well , that is the basic housing act . Do you know he voted against it as a Congressman ? He leads a party that voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties and votes 90 percent against $ 1.25 in 1960 .

political	1414	We 're going to have to have more in the field of education . We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ? It means higher prices , higher taxes for the American people .	unknown	They do n't care , and I 'll prove it . We have a bill which does it the American way , not one that would have compulsory health insurance that would reduce the standard of medical care , that would compel millions of people who do n't want it and did n't need it to have it , but , one , a bill in which every American over 65 who wanted health insurance can get it , either private or Government , but in which no one in this country is compelled to have it against his will . That 's the American way of handling this problem .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	1416	Mr. Nixon leads a party which in 1935 voted 99 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage . And Mr. Nixon last week said $ 1.25 minimum wage is inflationary . I would like to see any American get along who lives in political life , from the President , Vice President , to the two candidates , on $ 1.25 an hour .	unknown	For Mr. Nixon to say we ca n't afford to do more to clear our slums is downgrading America . The Republicans tell us our economy was never stronger ; then they tell us that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour would break its back . Who can raise a family on $ 1.25 an hour , $ 50 a week ? For Mr. Nixon to say $ 1.25 an hour is  extreme ,  as he did , is underrating the great potential strength of the American economy .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	1417	It shows you how we approach these problems , retaining individual enterprise , building on it , rather than supplementing it completely by Federal Government activities . Now , if I might turn to another subject , the last one , the most important of all , what could be more important than medical care , I am sure some of you may ask , or jobs , schools , the 4-day week in schools ? What could be more important that all these things ? Well , you know . The ability to be able to be around to enjoy them - and I say , as I said last night and as I will say throughout this campaign , that the most important issue in this campaign is this : Which of the two candidates for the Presidency is best qualified , by experience , by judgment , by background , to keep the peace , but keep the peace without surrender of principle or territory for the United States and the world ? This is the great issue .	unknown	Now , what does this mean ? This means that we do want progress in this country , and want it to increase , but , my friends , the way to get it is to recognize that the engine of progress in the United States is not the Federal Government , but 180 million free individual Americans inspired by Government . Our opponents say they want progress and they 'll produce it , but you know how they say they 're going to get it ? They 're going to set up a huge new Government program in everything , whether its medical care or schools or housing or anything else , turn it over to the Federal Government , and they say this proves they care more for progress , that they will produce more .

Although there are 4 million unemployed workers in this country - forced to get by on an average unemployment compensation check of $ 31 a week - the Republican Party has blocked all Democratic efforts to modernize and extend our system of unemployment compensation . Although 5 million Americans must struggle for survival on Government surplus foods consisting of less than $ 10 a month worth of rice , flour , cornmeal and dried eggs for a family of four - the Republicans have refused to put into operation an expanded food distribution program voted by a Democratic Congress .	unknown	 If it remains there it is entitled to special Government help through defense procurement and other programs .

The justification for applying the proposed new minimum wage to the newly covered employees is the same as the reasoning which supports the increase in the minimum . The employees have the same needs .	unknown	In the case of both of those bills , in the House Rules Committee , not one of the Republican members would vote to bring either one of those bills to the floor of the House . My understanding is that the only way that they reach an agreement to permit the minimum wage was because they had an understanding with the House conferees that they would not go beyond the House bill .

political	1421	I do not agree - and the Democratic Party has never agreed .

Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth .	unknown	A real  truth squad ,  for example , would find it necessary to ask Mr. Nixon such questions as these : 1. Why do you repeat the statement that real wages have gone up 15 percent during the present administration compared with only 2 percent in the previous one , when your own Department of Labor figures clearly establish that the increase between September 1945 ( the first postwar month ) and January 1953 was 18.3 percent while the increase between January 1953 and August 1960 has been 13.7 percent . 2. Why have you not personally admitted that you misquoted me when you said that in my Detroit speech on Labor Day I had said  What the American labor movement wants for America is what I want for America  when this statement did not appear in either my advance statement or in the speech as actually delivered ? 3. When you insist that Federal aid to teachers salaries means Federal control over education , are you aware of the fact that the present program for aid to federally impacted areas has been free of such control , and that the provision which you killed with your tie-breaking vote contained explicit language ruling out any Federal  direction , supervision , or control over the policy determinations , personnel , program of instruction , or the administration or operation of any school or school system  ? 4. How can you claim credit for the present administration for more new water project starts than any other time in our history , when the stated Republican position except in campaign election years has been a no-new-starts policy that the Democratic Congress has sought to overcome ? 5. How can you call the vetoed 1960 Democratic bill on depressed areas  straight pork barrel  when your own Secretary of Labor , just 24 hours before the veto was announced , called the bill  good enough so that any Senator or Congressman from a State with areas of chronic unemployment would have no alternative but vote for it  ? 6. Why do you take credit for the present levels of operations at the National Institutes of Health , when the Democratic Congress , ignoring threats of veto , raised the administration request from $ 400 million to $ 560 million for the present year - the sixth consecutive year that Democrats have raised administration requests ? 7.

Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	unknown	And I say that we can not and should not blame ourselves , our policies , our negotiators , their scientific advisers , or their instructions , for the unyielding refusal of the Soviets to make an agreement at Geneva . The time and patience which we have already expended to explore this way out of the disarmament dilemma have been full proof of our own intentions and those of the Soviets . The blame rests squarely on them .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1429	Yet that is just what we have been urged to do . When all the vague generalities are stripped away , nothing more is being offered by opponents of the Anderson amendment than an increase in the public assistance program to provide some increased medical care for the indigent . The committee bill does improve our public assistance to the most needy .	unknown	This last session of the Congress for the last 4 weeks is a vivid example of what can happen when the country is divided in its leadership ; because the Republican Party opposed the $ 1.25 minimum wage , we did n't get it . Because the Republican Party - and only one Senator voted against them - opposed medical care for the aged tied to social security , which had the endorsement of Governor Rockefeller , as well as the Democratic Party , and it was beaten by five votes . And Time magazine this week said that the leader of the Republican Party smiled when he heard the results - this is the kind of thing which has happened in the month of August .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	1430	We are trying to encourage individual responsibility . Now let 's take medical care for the aged . I can speak from a personal standpoint about this .	unknown	Here are the facts . I have fought for and will continue to fight for a voluntary Federal - State plan of medical care for the aged - a plan under which all persons 65 and over of moderate means could receive more help than they would receive under Mr. Kennedy 's plan . In addition , under his plan for a compulsory Federal health insurance program many of the wealthy would receive help and 3 million senior citizens with incomes of $ 2,000 or less would receive no help .	unknown	support	medical care,health care
political	1431	We can not do that by arguing with him - and we ca n't do that by smiling at him . The only way we can get his agreement to disarmament is by our strength of armaments , enough to stop the next war before it starts . That requires only one kind of defense policy - a policy summed up in one word - first .	unknown	No home was safe and there was no freedom of religious worship . Mr. Khrushchev is in our country now , as he was a year ago , confident that all is going his way , smug in his recent successes , and piously talking about peace , colonialism , and disarmament . But how can you talk of peace , Mr. Khrushchev , when you and your Chinese Communist friends are undermining the peace every day , creating disorder and danger wherever you move ? How can you talk of colonialism when you are surrounded by your puppet dictators and when you hold in an iron grip a great empire stretching from East Berlin to Vietnam ? How can you talk of the achievements of your system , even if you beat us again by putting a man into outer space ? For we know that while you may bring a man back from outer space , you rarely bring one back alive from Siberia .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

We had no position and we adopted that of the British .	unknown	We are already racing from the jet age to the space age before meeting the safety , airport development , and other problems of the former . Space exploration that unravels the secrets of our universe , reconnaissance satellites that can replace a hundred U-2 planes watching over all the world , civilian travel in space vehicles , and the rule of law and disarmament in space itself , all these lie ahead of this generation . But we need not look only to the skies for new horizons .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1436	So part of it requires a local effort and part of it requires a State effort and part of it requires a national effort . I believe the next President of the United States should sign the following bills , and if I am elected I will do so : 1. The area distress bill , a bill which put the credit and power and vigor of the economy of the Federal Government in those areas where unemployment is higher than 7 or 8 percent for a long period of time . In other words , the Federal Government will loan its credit to businesses that wish to come to areas such as this , will provide vocational retraining for older workers , provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for those who are out of work for a long time , will aid in cleansing the rivers , will aid in trying to bring new industry into this area .	unknown	But our goals are not the same . I want a $ 1.25 an hour minimum wage , medical care for the aged through social security , Federal aid to help raise teachers salaries as well as schools , an adequate program of slum clearance and low-rent housing , and a program of aid to areas of chronic unemployment which would include northern Minnesota . These are my goals .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1437	The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration . Our unemployment benefits , too , must be standardized and extended . By assuring working Americans of a living wage , by assuring unemployed Americans that they will be able to have the basic necessities of life , we help not only New England against substandard competition ; we help the entire Nation .	unknown	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years has voted aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people . But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1439	I do n't think the monetary and fiscal policies which this administration has followed are good enough . I believe that when they stand against the minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , I think they are standing in the way of progress . We have high interest rates and as a partial result we built this year 200,000 less homes than we needed in this country to stay up with our population .	unknown	In the midthirties , 90 percent of the Republican Party voted against a 25-cent minimum wage . This summer , as your Congressman can tell you , in the House of Representatives , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week , for a business that makes more than a million dollars a year , and Mr. Nixon called it extreme . He is frozen in the ice of his own indifference if I ever saw a Republican candidate who was .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	1440	In 1955 Mr. Nixon went to Cuba to view conditions for himself . But his only reaction was to praise  the competence and stability  of the Batista dictatorship which was , even then , threatened by Communist activities - and to say that  communism has reached its high-water mark in Latin America  at a time when Communist influence was beginning to rise , and only a few short years before the Communists took over all of Cuba . Mr. Nixon saw nothing wrong in Cuba - he made no recommendations for action - he did not warn America that danger was growing - and as a result the Communists took over Cuba with virtually no opposition from the United States .	unknown	Africa could determine to make itself free .

[ Applause .	unknown	But in the past 8 years we have not demonstrated such concern . We have reacted to a crisis in Guatemala or a crisis in Panama or a crisis in Cuba , and then , when the crisis was over , we continued to ignore the long-range problems and needs which were at the root of all the trouble . The good neighbor policy is no longer enough .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1442	Only that approach can provide the required protection in a satisfactory way . Can there really be any doubt that systematic prepayment under the insurance system is to be preferred to the increased drain on general revenues ? Can there be anything but doubt about the ability of the States to raise money - especially when about half of the States now fail to match all the Federal funds at their disposal ? Can we really , in this day and age , say in all honesty that 50 different States with 50 different abilities to finance medical care are to be preferred to an orderly , nationwide system ? Can we really say that we favor social insurance for retirement , survivors and disability benefits , so as to avoid putting the relief tag on our citizens , and then make an exception when they become ill ? Mr. President , the answers are clear . I urge the adoption of the Anderson amendment .	unknown	Only one Senator voted with us in the U.S. Senate , Senator Case of New Jersey , a Republican , so that record is very clear . Even though at the outset the medical care to the aged was endorsed not only by Democrats but by Governor Rockefeller . It is a fact that the Vice President voted against the establishment in Mr. Flemming 's own Department , HEW , in 1951 or 1952 .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	1443	My friends this is n't Just a moot question . What if he had been President and done this And then Cuba , where all the newspapers in this country and in this continent , interpreted his remarks on Cuba to indicate intervention by the Government in that country , which would have brought disastrous consequences , lose our friends in America , lose our friends throughout the world , and invited the very Communists to come into this country that we do not want - all these things . My friends , three times he 's had a chance .	unknown	I think my opponent was wrong . And more recently , in Cuba where he says that our policy of quarantining Mr. Castro is too little and too late , and where he advocated a policy which universally was interpreted as Government intervention in the affairs of that country , a policy which would have lost us every friend in Latin America , because it would have broken treaties with all of those countries , and a policy which , if carried out , would have invited war in this hemisphere , because certainly , if our Government had intervened , the Communists would have had a good excuse for coming in. Now , on all three of these points I recognize that Mr. Kennedy has said he has changed his mind , that he now supports the President on Quemoy and Matsu , that as far as Cuba is concerned , he did n't intend it to mean the way it sounded , and that in the field of the Paris Conference , that he agreed that the President , perhaps , conducted himself the right way under the circumstances ; but , my friends , that is n't enough . When you 're a candidate you can say something , make a mistake , and correct it the next day and nobody is the worse for it .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1444	I do n't mean that they have not come up with new legislation . The fact of the matter is that every piece of major legislation which is the hallmark of Franklin Roosevelt 's administration from social security to minimum wage , from the Securities and Exchange Act to TVA , every one of those pieces of legislation was opposed - at the time they were written - by the Republican Party . They say our goals are the same .	unknown	If the people 's interest is going to be protected , the President of the United States must stand for that protection . It is the President of the United States that can set the goals for the country in housing , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , and in equality of rights for all Americans , regardless of their race or color . I stand in direct succession to Truman and Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , who advanced the right of all Americans to participate equally in our society .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	1445	They are afraid of diplomatic policies that teeter on the brink of war . They are dismayed that our negotiators have no solid plans for disarmament . And they are discouraged by a philosophy that puts its faith in swapping threats and insults with the Russians .	unknown	Our aspiration is for peace , not merely a peace which lasts between wars , not merely a peace which hangs on the brink of war , not merely a peace of the death , but a peace enforced and controlled by the United Nations against the universal danger of common destruction . We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive implements of war may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament , in a great multinational effort to harness our rivers , eradicate disease , take care of our children , care for the aged . We want a peace in which we can truly beat our swords into plowshares , and our hydrogen bombs into atomic reactors .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1446	I contrast that call to the dim , silent trumpet that this administration has given forth in the last few years . In Cuba , the Communists have established a satellite . In Venezuela , angry mobs assault the Vice President of the United States .	unknown	After doing nothing for 6 years while the conditions that give rise to communism grew - after ignoring the repeated warning of our Ambassadors that the Communists were about to take over Cuba - after standing helplessly by while the Russians established a new satellite only 90 miles from American shores - Mr. Nixon and the Republicans , after 2 years of inaction since Castro took power , now attempt to make up for this incredible history of blunder , inaction , retreat and failure , by cutting off several million dollars worth of exports in a move which will have virtually no effect by itself in removing Communist rule from Cuba . In cutting off a carefully limited number of the American goods which can be sent to Cuba Mr. Nixon has made a dramatic but almost empty gesture - a gesture which will have so little impact on Castro as to be almost meaningless . The State Department itself admits that our exports to Cuba have already declined by more than 50 percent since Castro took power .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1447	Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations . A successful blueprint for a safe disarmament is as difficult to devise as a successful blueprint for modern war . But the hard facts of the matter are that we have fewer than 100 people in the entire Federal Government working on these problems .	unknown	We must also be ready to reassume the initiative in the conduct of our foreign affairs - or act to spread freedom as well as to react against the spread of communism . We must propose new and workable programs for disarmament , for banning nuclear testing , for reducing tensions in the many trouble spots around the world from Berlin to the Formosa Straits . For only an America which is applying its full resources of imagination and thought and strength to the resolution of the world 's great problems - only such an America will be able to maintain its position as the champion of peace and the protector of freedom everywhere .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	1448	The nature of the employer 's business is irrelevant . Thus , there may be two employees , working side by side in the employ of the same employer , one of whom is protected by the statutory minimum wage and one who is not . For example , a wholesaler 's order clerk who typed orders for goods purchased out of State would be entitled to the statutory minimum , but the billing clerk at the next desk who typed bills for customers inside the State would lack the same protection .	unknown	From now until November 8 we are taking our ease to the forum in which it belongs , where there is no threat of veto , where there is no parliamentary obstruction , and where we will be successful - and that is the forum of the American people . Until a Democrat is in the White house , the Republicans can block action on an adequate minimum wage , they can water down medical care for the aged , they can play politics with civil rights , they can block action on a decent housing bill and a good school bill . But they can not block the American people on November 8. The theme of this campaign is going to be action - action at home to keep pace with our growing needs , to help the unfortunate , to build a still greater nation - and action abroad , to match the rise in Communist power , to meet the turbulent revolutions reshaping our globe .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage

Yes ; he has worked for disarmament but not a phony disarmament because this Nation must never disarm until we get absolute assurance that those who threaten the peace of the world , as we do not , are also disarming at the same time . And all Americans support the President in that I 'm sure .	unknown	We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	unknown	support	disarmament

He now agrees with the President on Cuba - he did n't mean Federal intervention in Cuba . But , my friends , remember this : I 've been in the Office of the President when he 's made great decisions .	unknown	He was wrong and Dwight Eisenhower was right - and thank God Dwight Eisenhower was President [ cheers and applause ] because , you see , if regrets had been expressed Khrushchev would have ground us into a pulp and got his demands on Berlin . And the third point - and this is what I call shooting from the hip - the difficult problem in Cuba , this little pipsqueak , Castro , down there stirring it up ; and , so , everybody says ; Why do n't we get rid of him ? Why do n't we send the Marines in ? My friends , the reason we do n't is that we do n't want to make a second Hungary out of 5 million people on the island of Cuba .

These are the things that we have to do to try to build a strong country here , to try to build a progressive and forward-looking country that 's meeting its problems , to try to find some way to distribute our food .	unknown	[ Cheers and applause . ] And I can only add to what Cabot Lodge has said : It is very easy to do as our opponents have - to say the President was wrong on Quemoy and Matsu in not surrendering two islands of freedom ; he was wrong in not apologizing to Khrushchev ; he was wrong in what he did in Cuba , and then to take it back the next day .

Can you estimate how long your disarmament duties will keep you under this self-imposed noncampaigning status ? A. Well , it is n't really self-imposed . It is - would obviously be inappropriate for me to , as the U.S. representative to the United Nations - to engage in partisan politics .	unknown	We want a peace in which the world is not teetering constantly on the brink of war . We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive forces of armaments may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament - into great multi-Nation efforts to eradicate disease , harness rivers , eliminate illiteracy , and exploit the frontiers of space .

You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	unknown	[ Applause . ] The second bill that was up and which is an issue in this campaign was a bill to provide $ 1.25 minimum wage . Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

Can you tell me one piece of new legislation which benefits our people that has been passed in the last 8 years ? I ca n't name one .	unknown	Now , a lot of people , l know , could well raise the question as to whether there are other things that are more important as far as this election campaign is concerned than programs that will keep the peace and extend freedom and keep freedom in this country . And I certainly would reply by saying that other things also are very important : We want better schools in America ; we want better health care in America available to all of our citizens ; we want better jobs for our people ; we also want to see the income of our farm families participate in the tremendously increasing prosperity which Americans are enjoying . But , above all , my friends , we want to see these young people , these schoolchildren who by the thousands we have seen along the streets of these Iowa towns and cities today , and who are here by the thousands , we want to see that they grow up to enjoy all these other good things - that they do have a life of peace for themselves and for the world .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care

Here it was shooting from the hip , but missing the mark , the President taking the correct position of quarantining Mr. Castro , quarantining him by economic and political means , and Mr. Kennedy then saying this is n't enough , we 've got to go further and then making the outrageous suggestion that the Government of the United States should intervene directly - and that 's the way it was interpreted all over the world - into Cuba . This would have invited the Communists in , probably resulted in civil war or world war .	unknown	It did not require the polls taken by the U.S. Information Service to tell us that the balance of power is not shifting in our direction . Cuba , Latin America , Asia , China , Russia - the world is full of hazards and peril and opportunity in the 1960 's , and those hazards can be overcome , those perils can be met , those opportunities seized only if we in the United States are building a strong society committed to progress which the Republican Party has never been .

political	1462	Unemployment is not insignificant to an America which desperately needs the skills and labor of all its citizens if it is to rebuild the strength which alone can maintain the cause of peace and freedom in a perilous and changing world . And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population .	unknown	In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million . Let 's face it : It took war to solve the unemployment riddle for them . After the war was over opposition spokesmen forecast some 6 million unemployed .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	1465	In other words , disarmament without inspection increases the risk of war . It 's only disarmament with inspection that will reduce the risk of war . So , I pledge to you that , with my colleague , Cabot Lodge , to whom I am going to give special assignments in this field , we will take the initiative at every opportunity to deal with Mr. Khrushchev and to work out whatever arrangement we can that will provide inspection for disarmament , for tests , for all these other items which I am discussing tonight .	unknown	Such an effort requires not only long-term development loans but education , student exchanges , stepped up Voice of America broadcasts , concerned and competent Ambassadors , and a wide range of measures designed to increase the strength of freedom and stimulate the economic advance on which freedom often depends . Fourth , we will strengthen our planning the preparation for disarmament . One of the most glaring failures of the past 8 years has been our failure to prepare properly for any arms control conference since the end of the Korean war .	unknown	attack	disarmament

Second , we must establish an arms control research institute , under the direction of the President , to undertake , coordinate , and follow through on the research , development , and policy planning needed for a workable disarmament program . Detection and monitoring systems will require new techniques of aerial reconnaissance and radar surveillance , new uses for our communications systems , computers , and cameras , new ways to denature plutonium and inspect power reactors , and a whole host of additional research projects .	unknown	 Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace . We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	1468	Now , people disagree with that . Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson believe that the social security route , which would compel all people - whether they wanted health insurance or not - to , in effect , have it through subscribing to social security , is the best one to provide medical care or people over 65 . I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance .	unknown	[ Applause . ] As long as there are 9 million Americans over the age of 65 who receive incomes of less than $ 20 a week , 3 million more receiving incomes of less than $ 40 a week , amounts on which they can not possibly afford to pay for their medical bills , and yet in the August session of the Congress , in our attempt to tie medical care for the aged to social security , we received the support of only one member of the minority party , Senator Case of New Jersey - that is the record of that party and we are going to defeat them in November .

political	1469	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration .

From 1946 to 1953 , while still in charge , they gave the Nation 7 years of inflation .	unknown	I had one of them in my own State , Lawrence , Mass . , where the unemployment rate was 35 percent for 3 years , and the reason , of course , was because we lost our textile mills .

If you think that party is committed to progress , then Mr. Nixon is your man .	unknown	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1472	I will tell you today the things that I believe are necessary , the program that I stand for . I will tell you , for example , that I think we need economic policies that will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million people , that will increase employment , that we need Government policies , for example , which will provide better guarantees and better protection against unemployment than we presently have . I will tell you today , for example , that I think those policies will produce more economic programs and progress than will the policies of our opponents .	unknown	If the people 's interest is going to be protected , the President of the United States must stand for that protection . It is the President of the United States that can set the goals for the country in housing , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , and in equality of rights for all Americans , regardless of their race or color . I stand in direct succession to Truman and Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , who advanced the right of all Americans to participate equally in our society .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	1473	I 'm proud of that record , and we have a program that will produce greater progress and greater prosperity on those issues for America in the future , I can assure you . But may I say it would n't be enough to rest our case there because , you know , you can have the best jobs , the best social security , the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy it . And , so , I say peace without surrender , the extension of freedom , this is the great issue .	unknown	Franklin Roosevelt said ,  This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny ,  and so does this one , so does this one 25 years later . It is not only medical care for the aged . It is minimum wage , it is housing for the elderly , public housing .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	1476	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .	unknown	[ Applause . ] I do n't believe that this city and the State of Ohio wants for a President of the United States in 1961 , a man who thinks a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour for someone working in interstate commerce is extreme . I do n't believe that anyone who believes in Federal aid to education , and to make sure that our teachers are well compensated - anyone who believes that that is extreme , I do n't believe the American people are going to endorse that leadership .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1477	I would like to ask Mr. Nixon one single piece of new , progressive legislation , benefiting the people that the Republicans have put forward in the last 25 years . Ninety percent of the Republican Party in 1935 voted against the minimum wage of 25 cents an hour , and 80 percent of them voted against $ 1.25 in 1960 . The fact of the matter is that this State and the United States can not sit still in the 1960 's .	unknown	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1478	Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it . I think these issues are important , not because the minimum wage is maybe the most important issue in the United States today , and not because medical care for the aged itself may be the most important issue , and not because aid to education itself may be the most important issue . I think the most important issue is the security of the United States and the peace of the world .	unknown	They talked . But what did they produce ? They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ? Nothing at all .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1479	In short , no problem is more vital or more urgent in the struggle for peace than the problem of effective arms control . Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands .	unknown	And I say that we can not and should not blame ourselves , our policies , our negotiators , their scientific advisers , or their instructions , for the unyielding refusal of the Soviets to make an agreement at Geneva . The time and patience which we have already expended to explore this way out of the disarmament dilemma have been full proof of our own intentions and those of the Soviets . The blame rests squarely on them .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	1480	We will never negotiate with appeasement in mind . But we must be willing and we must search out the ways to find agreement where agreement is possible , on disarmament , on reducing tensions , throughout the world . And may I say in this case - and I am going to make an announcement at this time that I know will please you - that coming into Hawaii later in the campaign will be a man who is my running mate .	unknown	 It is impossible for us to provide for the disarmament of outer space , the disarmament of nuclear weapons , unless we are in a position of parity with the Soviet Union . This administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament . I think we can do a better job than that .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1481	When a political party votes , in 1935 , 98 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage , I know what the party stands for ; and when that same political party in 1960 votes in the House of Representatives 85 percent against $ 1.25 minimum wage in 1960 , I know the Republican Party stands where it has always stood-against ; not for , but against . Mr. Nixon leads a party which regards $ 1.25 minimum wage as extreme , which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as extreme . Mr. Nixon leads a party which Alf Landon once led , from Pennsylvania .	unknown	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1482	I think I should prefer to answer it in this way , the only responsible way . As President Eisenhower has indicated time and time again , the United States can not tolerate Russian influence or a Russian-dominated government in Cuba or in the Americas . Now the President has made that clear .	unknown	For we have not only supported a dictatorship in Cuba - we have propped up dictators in Venezuela , Argentina , Colombia , Paraguay , and the Dominican Republic . We not only ignored poverty and distress in Cuba - we have failed in the past 8 years to relieve poverty and distress throughout the hemisphere . For despite the bleak poverty that grips nearly all of Latin America - with an average income of less than $ 285 a year - with an exploding population that threatens even this meager standard of living - yet our aid programs have continued to concentrate on wasteful military assistance until we made a sudden recognition of their needs for development capital practically at the point of Mr. Castro 's gun .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1483	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	We were not as successful as I hoped we would be . But I think the real difficulty is the fact that on the two bills which were most controversial , the $ 1.25 minimum wage , and the aid to the aged and social security , we were informed in both cases that if those bills passed , the President would veto them . All the President has to do to stop action is to veto any bill and he needs , according to the Constitution , only one-third plus one of either body to sustain his veto .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	1484	The sorry lack of concern for the American people too often revealed by my opponent and his followers can be no better documented than by the record on distressed areas legislation . Five years in a row the President has recommended Federal help for those areas in our country affected with chronic unemployment . But my opponent and his party have preferred to make a political football out of a pressing human problem .	unknown	That is why there are major pockets of unemployment in every center of heavy industry - in Buffalo , in Seattle , in Detroit , in Pittsburgh , in Youngstown . That is why unemployment is edging toward the 6 million mark . That is why the economy seems to be sliding into the third recession in 6 years .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1485	But the burden which should concern us most lies upon the American conscience . We can no longer tolerate growing patches of poverty and injustice in America - substandard wages , unemployment , city slums , inadequate medical care , inferior education and the sad plight of migratory workers . The enactment of this bill is only one step , but an essential step forward , as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation .	unknown	Let me speak now of a more important issue . I am sure when you heard the words  more important  some of you thought :  What could be more important than education for our children , a better job , adequate hospitals and health care , all these things that I have mentioned ?  The answer is :  We can have the best social security system , the best education , the best jobs that we can imagine , and it is not going to do any good unless we are around to enjoy them .  So I urge all of you , without regard to your partisan affiliations , to have this major issue in mind as you go to the polls on election day :  Which of the two candidates , which of the two tickets , do you believe best provides the kind of leadership that will keep the peace for America and keep it without a surrender of principle ?  Here we think we have a good record .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	1486	I just do n't believe that the 1960 's is a time to stand still . Every piece of important legislation of benefit to our people was opposed by the Republicans when they first came into being , away back to the Federal Reserve Board , all the reforms of the Roosevelt administration , social security , all the others , minimum wage , housing , benefits to the farmers , all opposed . Now , with that long history , TVA , the development of our resources , all in opposition , with that long history , how can we expect that that party and that candidate can move this country ahead , with all the changes coming on , the prospects for unemployment , the recession possibly this winter in 1961 , with our farm income down 25 percent , with 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never seeing the inside of a college , who graduate from high school , our prestige in the world being affected , with Communists on the march , Castro on the march .	unknown	I would answer the question , hoping that I am hitting the point , and if it does n't , if he will call back in , we will give this question priority . I have answered the question by saying that I favor the raising of the minimum wage to $ 1.15 . I also favor extending coverage to 3 million people not presently covered .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1487	That goes particularly today against the Soviet Union and the Chinese . We are going to have to wait and see what happens in Cuba . But any action that we do take , in my opinion , should be taken in concert with the Organization of American States .	unknown	We have cooperated with and supported the United Nations . We have not bullied Cuba , in spite of the provocation of its Communist-oriented government . We have dealt with this threat to the peace and stability of the hemisphere as we pledged we would in our solemn treaty commitments .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1488	And on the other side there is the wrong and demagogic way - the right that I have pointed out , the wrong which Senator Kennedy has advocated - and I say this is a way of shooting from the hip on matters gravely affecting the security of the United States . And , so , finally , let 's look at the record , all three , the position on Quemoy and Matsu - slice off a bit of freedom ; maybe it will lead to peace ; the position on the summit conference - express regrets to Khrushchev ; maybe we can save the conference , and then this latest episode with regard to Cuba . I think when you look at these three episodes that this should convince many Americans that they could not rest well at night with a man with such a total lack of judgment as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces in this critical period .	unknown	Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . Now it is Cuba . These latter two are important issues but I think the American people want and deserve to hear us discuss all the important problems which face our country and to limit the subject of the fifth to one country would be to subvert the purpose of such a debate .	unknown	attack	cuba

The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	unknown	And this administration says , when we try to provide aid to education , when we try to provide medical care for the aged , it is too extreme . When we try to pass $ 1.25 minimum wage , per hour , $ 50 a week [ applause ] $ 50 a week , Mr. Nixon says it is extreme .

political	1491	Quite obviously they did in both the House and Senate .

To the Asian , this report said , the administration 's policy on Cuba  was a clear case of American indecision , fumbling , and possible weakness .

We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	unknown	After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference .

You can learn about political science by participating in political organizations , and I would say certainly a political science course under the very able people who instruct you in our colleges and universities is worth while , but particularly to those who want to enter public service , if I could leave just one note - Remember , that while the broad background in the humanities and history and literature would seem to be very remote from the problems of Ghana and Cuba , from the problems of what we do about health care and what we do about the filibuster , remember those are the courses that will give you the judgment and the depth that is needed to react properly and intelligently to these great issues when they come before you years later , if you happen to enter public life . The last point that I would make is this : I want everybody here to certainly feel the necessity for , as I put it , going into politics ; I do n't mean all of you should run for office .	unknown	Why did the people of Ghana and the leadership decide , even though an independent country , even with a great tradition of being tied to the British , even though they had every prospect of maintaining a society tied to the West , why have they in the last 3 years since they have been independent suddenly begun to tie their policies closely to that of the Soviet Union ? It is not chaos . It is not a military seizure of power like Cuba . Yet , Mr. Herter said 3 weeks ago that Ghana is supporting the foreign policy of the Soviet Union .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1499	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .	unknown	Let me say , briefly , I believe there are two points . First , those of you who are active in labor , those of you who lead organized labor movements , are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public , and you know very well , perhaps better than anyone , that this country still has unfinished business , that we have to maintain full employment , that we have to advance the standards of living of our people , of better housing , of better minimum wage , of medical care for the aged .

political	1500	 Is it true ? And the answer is , Of course it is n't true . The answer is - and now I 'm going to give you my version - the answer is that America , is moving forward , that unemployment went down more than usual last month and employment went up to record heights . The answer is that America will continue to move forward , continue to move forward , that is , unless we have some of our politicians talk us into a recession - and we are n't going to allow that to happen .	unknown	Social security ?

When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ?

It has been that attitude which has made this country great and we will restore it to the conduct of Government in 1961 .	unknown	I know what it is in the little store in which I worked to see a child of an unemployed man come in and have to ask to put things on the bill , knowing that his dad or hers probably was n't going to get a job for a while .

He advocates a balanced budget , except during times of emergency affecting the national security , or high rate of unemployment .

political	1511	The Republicans adopted the seemingly simple and easy policy of tightening interest rates when demand was strong and prices were rising - a principle that requires allowing rates to fall when the economy needed stimulation . But the facts of the matter are that each successive peak and each successive valley in the economy has ended with higher and higher interest rates - with the result that paradoxically high rates accompanied heavy unemployment , low production , and a slack economy . For this policy has not worked .	unknown	Listening to the opposition , one would never know that there are almost 68 million Americans at work in our $ 500 billion economy and that Americans are earning at a record annual rate of over $ 408 billion .

Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth . Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet .	unknown	But both of them lived many , many years longer , and both of them , the longer they lived , gained love and affection from the American people - and I would only hope tonight that , however this election turns out , Senator Kennedy and I in the years ahead will be able to conduct ourselves with the dignity , the decency which earned the esteem and the love of the American people for the two men who were engaged in that great campaign of 1928 .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ?

I have confidence in an America able to afford the best schools and the best teachers in the world - an America where no one is denied his full constitutional rights by reason of his race or religion - an America where every family lives in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - an America where the cost of living is not completely beyond those who work for a living - particularly those receiving an inadequate minimum wage of $ 1 an hour .

Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	unknown	The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one .

As President Eisenhower has indicated time and time again , the United States can not tolerate Russian influence or a Russian-dominated government in Cuba or in the Americas . Now the President has made that clear .	unknown	His ambitions extend far beyond his own shores . He has transformed the island of Cuba into a hostile and militant Communist satellite - a base from which to carry Communist infiltration and subversion throughout the Americas . With guidance , support , and arms from Moscow and Peiping , he has made anti-Americanism a sign of loyalty and anti-communism a punishable crime - confiscated over a billion dollars ' worth of American property - threatened the existence of our naval base at Guantanamo - and rattled red rockets at the United States , which can hardly close its eyes to a potential enemy missile or submarine base only 90 miles from our shores .	unknown	support	cuba
political	1549	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .	unknown	I believe that this country can do more for peace than it has done .

And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties .	unknown	But both of them lived many , many years longer , and both of them , the longer they lived , gained love and affection from the American people - and I would only hope tonight that , however this election turns out , Senator Kennedy and I in the years ahead will be able to conduct ourselves with the dignity , the decency which earned the esteem and the love of the American people for the two men who were engaged in that great campaign of 1928 .

I believe that America can fruitfully use all our present productive power and much more to meet our vital needs for schools and roads and power and all the rest as well as our commitments to the war against poverty and Communist subversion abroad .	unknown	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return .

I , as you know , happen to be a Quaker .	unknown	A recent independent survey concluded : The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research efforts .

It takes coverage away from some .	unknown	We secured the support of seven or eight or nine Republicans on these bills .

political	1558	First , while I said that the American economy was failing to move ahead fast enough to meet the needs of the Nation or the people , Mr. Nixon said that  We 'd never had it so good ,  that the Nation was enjoying  unexampled prosperity .  Since that time unemployment has risen to more than 6 percent , the highest since the great recession of 1958 . In the past 5 months we have lost almost $ 1 billion of our dwindling gold reserves to foreign banks .	unknown	He has come up with a notion for excusing young men from the draft in favor of vague service overseas .

political	1560	These are the things which divide our two parties . Medical care for the aged , aid to education , unemployment compensation insured by Federal minimum standards , a minimum wage , area redevelopment , development of our natural resources . I do n't believe there is any comparison in the record of our parties for 25 years , and I do n't think that there is any comparison in our approach to progressive social legislation which serves the people between Mr. Nixon and myself , I am glad to say .	unknown	I know that as my mother and father reached their seventies they had some difficult times because of illness , and I know that there 's nothing that touches the hearts of children more than to think of their parents and the problems that they have then . That 's one of the reasons why we have a program in the field of medical care for the older citizens - not one like our opponents ' that would n't take care of 3 million of the people who do n't happen to be on social security , but one that will give an opportunity for every older person in this country who wants health insurance coverage to have it . , but which will require nobody to have it against his will .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	1561	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	[ Applause . ] As long as there are 15 million Americans who live in substandard housing , 5 million American families which lack plumbing of any kind who live in our cities , as long as 9 million of our older citizens receive an income of less than $ 20 a week , as long as there are millions of Americans who lack the protection of even an inadequate minimum wage of $ 1 , as long as there are millions of Americans who lack an opportunity to develop their full resources , as long as there are 100,000-odd families in the State of West Virginia receiving inadequate surplus food packages , so long as there is need for us to recognize there is unfinished business in our society , in our generation , in our day .

Our negotiators had to leave Geneva during the Conference itself to come to Washington to find out what our position was , and again we failed to prepare for disarmament . Throughout the consistent history of indifference and failure the arms race has continued to mount .	unknown	Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done . We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	1563	Today , the country has 126 areas of substantial labor surplus - areas like Bay City , Flint , and the Iron Range - areas of declining industry - where there is poverty and hunger - where men have been searching for work , but can not find work . Unemployment in any of these areas harms the entire Nation , depriving all our industry of markets , decreasing total purchasing power , and depriving us of needed production . The distress may be regional , but the problem is a national problem .	unknown	One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force . His pessimistic talk today recalls to my mind the situation in 1953 when the Eisenhower administration assumed responsibility for the Nation 's affairs .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	1565	We should have just as much concern about these nursing homes as we do about hospitals , and the Federal Government can take the lead in correcting this serious national deficiency . Medical care under our old-age assistance program needs to be improved . The Congress in its last session took an important step in the direction of providing more medical care for the neediest .	unknown	We provide , under the program that we are offering and have worked for in the Congress , medical care for the aged tied to social security . Mr. Nixon leads a party in this campaign that voted 90 percent in the mid-thirties against social security itself ; and in the month of August 1960 , voted 95 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security . I believe in an America where every family can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood ; where children can play safely ; where no home is unsafe or unsanitary , and today there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , and yet , even though our population is increasing , we 're building this year 30 percent less homes in the month of September than we did a year ago - partly , because this administration in the last 15 months has vetoed two housing bills - and we were unable to pass one in this session of the Congress .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	1566	As you know , in the August session of Congress , we had a fight on this issue . The proposal that we put forward was to provide that medical care for the aged would be tied into the social security system . In other words , that during your working years you would contribute through the social security system , and then when you reached the age of retirement , 65 , you would receive assistance in paying your medical bills .	unknown	[ Cheers . ] But you k now what could be more important than our job ? What could be more important than our education for our young people ? What could be more important than health care for our older citizens and for ourselves ? And the answer is being around to enjoy all these good things . So I say to you today that the most important decision you will make on November 8 is this : Which of the candidates for the Presidency , for the Vice Presidency , can best furnish the leadership that will keep the peace for America without surrender and extend freedom throughout the world ?

The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .	unknown	It is our function , however , not to merely invoke the names of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman , not to merely live off what they did , but to bring these old programs up to date . Franklin Roosevelt proposed a 25-cent minimum wage , back in the middle thirties ; 90 percent of the Republicans voted against it . We proposed this summer a minimum wage of $ 1.25 and 90 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives voted against it .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

Perhaps the Communist Chinese will refuse to participate in arms control negotiation , even though their ultimate participation is essential to effective disarmament .

And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	1570	Unfortunately , a life of health , dignity , and independence in retirement has not been realized by millions of America 's senior citizens . The pioneering , exhaustive studies of the Senate Subcommittee on Problems of the Aged and Aging , led by Senator McNamara of Michigan and Senator Kennedy , provide conclusive statistical and human evidence that at least half of those over 65 - 8 million older Americans : have income inadequate for good nutrition and ordinary living ; have serious health problems and even more serious problems of paying for medical care . In addition , too many of the aged and aging : face discrimination in eniployment because of age ; have unsuitable , often unbearable , housing conditions ; have little recreation , too often resulting in isolation and mental disturbance .	unknown	Let me get one that is , indeed , very close , I am sure , to some people here . Let 's look at medical care for the aged . I feel very strongly on this .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	1571	A recent independent survey concludes , and I quote it accurately ,  The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research effort .  As a result , we have been unprepared at every disarmament conference that we have attended . At a time when our relative military strength was at its height , in the mid fifties , at a time when we had the best chance to reach an agreement on control of arms , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working on this subject .	unknown	The hope for peace is to be firm against those who threaten the peace so that they ca n't blackmail us .

And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1572	And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system . The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures . It imposes an ugly needs test-a  pauper 's oath  - for eligibility .	unknown	He promises a farm program that would force drastic cutbacks in production and marketing , force 2 million people out of work , trigger off inflation , sharply raise food prices , create food scarcity , and regiment all agriculture by setting up all sorts of new regulations and creating new battalions of Government overseers to watch over and tell every farmer what he could or could not do . He promises to impose a mandatory medical care plan for the aged on every one of the millions of citizens covered by social security , no matter what their personal desires , and leave 3 million Americans with no medical care program at all . My plan would not be compulsory and would provide medical care programs for all those who needed and wanted them .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	1573	Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others . Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring .	unknown	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	1574	And I really do n't think that we 've made enough progress , for example , in the area of disarmament in the last years . We 've only had about 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament , the subject of nuclear testing . That 's a terribly important subject .	unknown	It 's only disarmament with inspection that will reduce the risk of war . So , I pledge to you that , with my colleague , Cabot Lodge , to whom I am going to give special assignments in this field , we will take the initiative at every opportunity to deal with Mr. Khrushchev and to work out whatever arrangement we can that will provide inspection for disarmament , for tests , for all these other items which I am discussing tonight . And now we come to the key question , and one again I want to talk to you very frankly about .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1575	Mr. Nixon chose to devote his speech here to Cuba . If there would be one topic that I would be reluctant to discuss if I were Republican , it would be Cuba .

political	1576	Cuba is important but so are our relations with the Soviet Union , the problems of Latin America , Africa , and Asia . Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . Now it is Cuba .	unknown	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1577	But these rivers in the New York area are not so clean and we have to do a better job of maintaining them if you are going to bring industry in that needs fresh water . 3. I think this administration should pass a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour . [ Applause .	unknown	They talked . But what did they produce ? They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ? Nothing at all .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	1579	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare . At the London Conference of 1957 , the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties , and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament , we sent a man who had not been active in the field , Harold Stassen , we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position . Mr. Stassen was never able to get clear instructions at the meeting as to what our position was .	unknown	The hope for peace is to be firm against those who threaten the peace so that they ca n't blackmail us .

And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1580	Nor can we permit economic stagnation to continue in distressed areas . The administration has played politics with this issue - as well as with the minimum wage , health care for the aged , school construction , and housing programs . Every worker would do well to remember that the administration twice vetoed area redevelopment bills only to issue later pious protestations of concern and calls for action by Congress .	unknown	Some of you may raise a question here when I say this is the most important issue , but I am sure when you consider it you will agree with me . Other issues are important - whether or not we have a good job , the kind of social security that we have for our old age , the kind of medical care that we get , the development of the right kind of school system and all the other things in which all Americans are interested , but you know , we can have the best social security , the best housing , the best jobs that we could possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them . So , this is the issue of our time .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care
political	1581	We must never make a concession to them without getting a concession in return . As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace .	unknown	I would put more people into it . I would indicate our desire not only to maintain our strength , but also to provide for orderly disarmament . Thirdly , I would hope that the United States could make for effective judgments of the events that are going to occur .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	1583	Mr. Nixon believes a housing bill which will build homes for our people is extreme . Mr. Nixon believes that medical care for our older citizens tied to social security is extreme . We disagree on the goals of our country and we disagree on the means of attaining these goals .	unknown	Let me put it another way . Every time they see a problem , whether it 's schools , or housing , or medical care or anything else , they have an automatic reaction . Oh they say we have no confidence in the people .	unknown	support	medical care,health care
political	1584	But at the present time there is still a chance that the negotiations can result in an agreement in which testing will be discontinued by both the Soviet Union and the United States , or at least not resumed by both , assuming both have discontinued them , and that this agreement will have with it inspection procedures . Now the reason that it is vitally important that we continue to press forward until there is obviously no chance of success is that if we can get an agreement on nuclear testing , suspension of nuclear testing , with inspection , it opens the door and paves the way for disarmament with inspection . And this must be the goal of the President of the United States , whatever party he may be from .	unknown	 It is impossible for us to provide for the disarmament of outer space , the disarmament of nuclear weapons , unless we are in a position of parity with the Soviet Union . This administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament . I think we can do a better job than that .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1585	 The predicament that he 's confronted with , then , is one in which he must choose between the two . Now , how do you choose ? Well , first , you 've got to determine the qualifications of the candidates in terms of the record , and on the record , incidentally , I think we have a record here which absolutely proves that our programs will produce progress where theirs wo n't , because , whether it 's in the case of more schools , better housing , whether it 's in improved medical care , anything you want to take , you will find we have made more progress in these 7 years than was made in the 7 previous years . So , the record must be examined .	unknown	Those forced to rely on surplus food packages should receive a more balanced , nourishing diet . And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system . The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care

[ Response from the audience .	unknown	We know that it takes firmness and strength , but never belligerence .

political	1588	First , I think we should be extremely vigorous in our programs through Latin America . We have two problems : one through Cuba , itself , and the other through the rest of Latin America . That will be the big fight in the sixties , whether Castroism or communism will spread through other countries .	unknown	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today . Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	1589	It 's been done , incidentally , over the objection of some well-intentioned , but hopelessly naive Castro apologists within the United States - and all that I can say with regard to Senator Kennedy 's position is that he apparently is attempting to obscure his association with the views of this pro-Castro group as indicated in the book that I mentioned a moment ago or he must have thought now that there would be political advantage in taking a stronger position than I have taken , a radical position , instead of the strong and sound position that the administration has taken . And , so , what does he suggest ? He comes up , as I pointed up , with the fantastic recommendation that the U.S. Government shall directly aid the anti-Castro forces both in and out of Cuba . Now , every freedom-loving person in the United States - let 's make it clear - is in sympathy with the democratic anti-Castro forces in Cuba and outside Cuba .	unknown	I have never advocated and I do not now advocate intervention in Cuba in violation of our treaty obligations and in fact stated in Johnstown , Pa . , that whatever we did with regard to Cuba should be within the confines of international law .

political	1590	The score was 70 to 0 , and that 's a score for American prestige . And , so , I say to you on this element of prestige : Where is our sense of values ? Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige when in Hungary he shoots down thousands of Hungarian students and workers in the streets of Budapest ? And do we lose prestige when in Cuba , where we have all the power in the world , we do not use the power , but we work through an Organization of American States to attempt to bring that country back into the paths of freedom ? Does he gain and we lose ? Of course not . Does he gain prestige when he breaks up a conference like the Paris Conference , when he blocks the road to peace ? Do we lose when President Eisenhower goes the extra mile and talks for it ? Of course not .	unknown	Actually , the United States has given more assistance to Yugoslavia since the end of World War II than it has to all of Latin America combined . It is an unfortunate fact that the assistance which was proposed at the time of the Bogota Conference really represented assistance which the United States was determined to give Latin America only when our relations with Cuba soured to the point where we broke off the sugar quota .

I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	unknown	After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference .

Let me tell you something : There have been occasions in these last 7 years when I have seen the President make decisions , occasions when if he had made a mistake , the wrong decision , it might have led to war ; it might have led to surrender of principle of territory , but because he was wise , because he did the right thing , my friends , we 're here today - and I say to you that when we consider the record of my opponent , when we consider what he has said in this campaign , disagree and criticize the President for what he did on Quemoy and Matsu - he thought we should have drawn a line as we did in Korea - criticize the President because the President did not apologize to Mr. Khrushchev , did not express regrets - he said he could have expressed regrets , could have expressed regrets or apologized to him for the U-2 flights - disagreed with the President on Cuba and advocated a policy which , around the world and particularly around this hemisphere , has dismayed our allies - I say that on those three counts alone that they prove that we can not afford any opponent 's inexperience abroad or his extravagance at home , and the American people are going to vote that way on November the 8th .

Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2.

And growing unemployment and declining production tend to confirm this prophecy . Much of this growing decline in our relative economic strength has been due to Republican failure to realize that a growing economy requires bold and imaginative use of the tools of economic policy and of our abundant resources if that growth is to be maintained and stimulated .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	1606	I think my opponent was wrong . And more recently , in Cuba where he says that our policy of quarantining Mr. Castro is too little and too late , and where he advocated a policy which universally was interpreted as Government intervention in the affairs of that country , a policy which would have lost us every friend in Latin America , because it would have broken treaties with all of those countries , and a policy which , if carried out , would have invited war in this hemisphere , because certainly , if our Government had intervened , the Communists would have had a good excuse for coming in. Now , on all three of these points I recognize that Mr. Kennedy has said he has changed his mind , that he now supports the President on Quemoy and Matsu , that as far as Cuba is concerned , he did n't intend it to mean the way it sounded , and that in the field of the Paris Conference , that he agreed that the President , perhaps , conducted himself the right way under the circumstances ; but , my friends , that is n't enough . When you 're a candidate you can say something , make a mistake , and correct it the next day and nobody is the worse for it .	unknown	[ Applause . ] He says that aid to Cuba and Latin America 5 years ago would have prevented the rise of Castro .

If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	unknown	But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace .	unknown	attack	disarmament

At a time when our relative military strength was much higher than it is today , from 1953-55 , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working full time on disarmament . We did not come up with a single major new proposal for arms control .	unknown	We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests . Why ? Because they want a closed society and they want no inspection .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1609	But in the past 8 years we have not demonstrated such concern . We have reacted to a crisis in Guatemala or a crisis in Panama or a crisis in Cuba , and then , when the crisis was over , we continued to ignore the long-range problems and needs which were at the root of all the trouble . The good neighbor policy is no longer enough .	unknown	And I say to you today that in the affairs of nations , just as in the affairs of individuals , there comes a time when patience , which we have been displaying , is no longer a virtue - and that time is at hand as far as our dealings with Castro and his government are concerned . You will recall that last July we acted to safeguard our future sugar supplies by reducing the share allotted to Cuba . Now we must take further action to protect the interests of the United States and of our friendly sister Republics in the hemisphere .	unknown	support	cuba

Almost up to the opening day of the meeting , we had prepared no position , conducted no special research , formulated no realistic or constructive proposals .	unknown	People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr . Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done .

As President Eisenhower has indicated time and time again , the United States can not tolerate Russian influence or a Russian-dominated government in Cuba or in the Americas . Now the President has made that clear .	unknown	Only 90 miles away stood the United States - their good neighbor - the richest Nation on earth - its radios and newspapers and movies spreading the story of America 's material wealth and surplus crops . But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba , nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance - assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship - assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people - assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life . This year Mr. Nixon admitted that if we had formulated a program of Latin American economic development 5 years ago :  It might have produced economic progress in Cuba which might have averted the Castro takeover .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1613	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	For this is not the same Nation as it was in 1952 . Automation was little more than a word then - now it means unemployment and hardship for untold thousands of workers . The pressure on our schools - the plight of our elderly - the cost-price squeeze on our farmers - the decline of our cities - the high cost of medical care - these are newer and greater problems and pressures which in 1960 are still growing and changing and demanding new leadership .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

After doing nothing for 6 years while the conditions that give rise to communism grew - after ignoring the repeated warning of our Ambassadors that the Communists were about to take over Cuba - after standing helplessly by while the Russians established a new satellite only 90 miles from American shores - Mr. Nixon and the Republicans , after 2 years of inaction since Castro took power , now attempt to make up for this incredible history of blunder , inaction , retreat and failure , by cutting off several million dollars worth of exports in a move which will have virtually no effect by itself in removing Communist rule from Cuba . In cutting off a carefully limited number of the American goods which can be sent to Cuba Mr. Nixon has made a dramatic but almost empty gesture - a gesture which will have so little impact on Castro as to be almost meaningless .	unknown	As a matter of fact , this talk about the fact that Cuba is lost and that Ghana is lost , and Guinea is lost , incidentally - and they have also claimed that - is irresponsible in the extreme . Cuba is not lost . The fact that Castro , of course , is following a pro-Communist line at the present time causes us great concern , but there are plenty of things that we can do and are doing , and we 're taking some very firm steps , as you know , to quarantine Castro in that area .	unknown	attack	cuba

I think defense contracts should be fairly distributed across the Nation . I also support the reestablishment of the Defense Manpower Policy No.4, which was thrown out in 1952 , which provided that those defense contracts would go to those areas which were able to meet the competitive price and had over 8 percent unemployment .

This is just one example .	unknown	Those forced to rely on surplus food packages should receive a more balanced , nourishing diet . And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system .

political	1622	One last point I would like to make as far as recession is concerned : I think we can do some other things that will smooth out the business cycle . One in particular is with regard to unemployment compensation . I think that unemployment compensation - our unemployment compensation principles and programs - should be revised , so that we can have a more effective method .	unknown	So part of it requires a local effort and part of it requires a State effort and part of it requires a national effort . I believe the next President of the United States should sign the following bills , and if I am elected I will do so : 1. The area distress bill , a bill which put the credit and power and vigor of the economy of the Federal Government in those areas where unemployment is higher than 7 or 8 percent for a long period of time . In other words , the Federal Government will loan its credit to businesses that wish to come to areas such as this , will provide vocational retraining for older workers , provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for those who are out of work for a long time , will aid in cleansing the rivers , will aid in trying to bring new industry into this area .	unknown	support	unemployment
political	1623	There have been two recessions since 1952 and , as the Wall Street Journal has warned , a third could now be underway . During a recession , as unemployment rises , profits decline , and farmers and small businessmen suffer especially , the growth of the gross national product slows to a halt , and public revenues shrink . A free economy can not have a perfectly regular rate of growth .	unknown	So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2.

I believe in medical care for the aged , nursing care , all tied to social security , which has served our people so well for 25 years . I believe in an expanding America where there is equality of opportunity , regardless of religion , regardless of race , regardless of creed .	unknown	We say that in the field of education we are proud that we stand for a program that will build more schools , that will raise the levels of our teachers ' salaries , but which rejects the program that they have that would endanger the right of the States to control education and that would , in effect , give to the Federal government the power not only to pay teachers , but to tell them what to teach - and that must never happen in the United States of America .

political	1625	I would put this directly at the top . On the question of Castro , I would attempt to tell the people of Cuba by every known way , including radio and television , and today we have no radio or television to Cuba from the Government , telling them that we want them to be free , that Castro is past . And by working with the people of Latin America and the governments trying to isolate Castro until finally the people of Cuba can be free again .	unknown	And then my opponent said : Oh , this is too little ; this is too late - and , shooting from the hip , but missing the mark , as he so often has done [ cheers and applause ] - what he did was - he shot from the hip , and he said - this is too little and too late . The Government should directly aid the anti-Castro forces in and out of Cuba . And a storm of protest arose all over the Americas , in the United Nations ; and , so , the next day he said : I did n't mean it that way .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	1626	And on the other side there is the wrong and demagogic way - the right that I have pointed out , the wrong which Senator Kennedy has advocated - and I say this is a way of shooting from the hip on matters gravely affecting the security of the United States . And , so , finally , let 's look at the record , all three , the position on Quemoy and Matsu - slice off a bit of freedom ; maybe it will lead to peace ; the position on the summit conference - express regrets to Khrushchev ; maybe we can save the conference , and then this latest episode with regard to Cuba . I think when you look at these three episodes that this should convince many Americans that they could not rest well at night with a man with such a total lack of judgment as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces in this critical period .	unknown	This is certainly the record with regard to the speeches you have been making in the past 45 hours on Cuba . I have never advocated and I do not now advocate intervention in Cuba in violation of our treaty obligations and in fact stated in Johnstown , Pa . , that whatever we did with regard to Cuba should be within the confines of international law .	unknown	attack	cuba
political	1627	And for those who talk about our prestige , does Mr. Khrushchev gain in prestige because he breaks up a conference , a conference that is designed to alleviate tensions ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he maintains dignity and say I will go an extra mile ? Of course not . Talk about the situation , for example , in Cuba . Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige because he shoots down hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of Budapest in Hungary ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he does not use our great power as he could against Mr. Castro in Cuba and the Cuban people ? But he works with other American States in developing the opinions which will keep the Cuban people on our side when eventually they get the right to choose the kind of government they want to .	unknown	We occupy a position of leadership in the world , but I think we can do far better , than our record of the past 2 or 3 or 4 years . Can you tell me anywhere in a crisis , from Cuba to the Congo to Laos , where the United States has been ahead of events ? We have held out our hands of friendship to the people of Latin America before we had to , where we did it at our own free will rather than at the point of Castro 's pistol ?

We tried to pass a bill comparable to that during the last session of the Congress .	unknown	Some of you may raise a question here when I say this is the most important issue , but I am sure when you consider it you will agree with me . Other issues are important - whether or not we have a good job , the kind of social security that we have for our old age , the kind of medical care that we get , the development of the right kind of school system and all the other things in which all Americans are interested , but you know , we can have the best social security , the best housing , the best jobs that we could possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them .

And we can not avoid the menace of a Communist base on Cuba , only 90 miles from our shores , merely by wishing it had not happened , though I wish it had not . I wish this administration had been as alert to that as they now say they were .	unknown	Now he says he really did n't mean it that way .

We 'd lose every friend we have in Latin America .	unknown	I have never advocated and I do not now advocate intervention in Cuba in violation of our treaty obligations and in fact stated in Johnstown , Pa . , that whatever we did with regard to Cuba should be within the confines of international law .

How then can you stand before any American audience and say that your way is going to produce more progress than his when the Federal Government is going to spend more under his program ?  Now put yourself in my position for a moment .	unknown	This year again the Republican Party - as it always has in the past - is fighting every single Democratic effort to advance the welfare of our people to relieve poverty and hunger and the burdens of illness . This year again only a single Republican in the Senate voted for medical care for the aged .

We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	unknown	Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others . Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

And I believe that most businessmen share my concern - and share my belief that we can do better .	unknown	Listening to the opposition , one would never know that there are almost 68 million Americans at work in our $ 500 billion economy and that Americans are earning at a record annual rate of over $ 408 billion .

Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	unknown	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare . At the London Conference of 1957 , the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties , and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament , we sent a man who had not been active in the field , Harold Stassen , we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position .

There are many kinds of waste , and I think it is the function of government to use our resources to the fullest , to use our natural and material and human resources to the fullest , to educate our children , to build a stronger economy , to provide medical care for our aged under social security , to use to the fullest those areas of the United States where unemployment has been chronic for a great many years , to use our brains and our energy to build a stronger and better society here in the United States . I think the future is ging to be a difficult one for us , but I have the greatest confidence in this country .	unknown	Thomas Jefferson has often made the point that the greatest guarantee of freedom is to diffuse power and that we must not have concentration of power in an all-powerful Federal Government , and it is because we believe that any kind of program that would put immense power in the Federal Government over our school system is something that Americans should reject , not because of the amount of money that is being spent , but because this kind of power is something which , in the wrong hands , would be something that all Americans would be against .

Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth . Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet .	unknown	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2.

And finally , although 9 million Americans over the age of 65 receive incomes of less than $ 20 a week - and 3 million more receive incomes of less than $ 40 a week - amounts on which they can not afford their higher medical bills - the Republican Party , only 2 weeks ago , blocked our efforts to provide medical care for the aged under social security .

political	1657	No home was safe and there was no freedom of religious worship . Mr. Khrushchev is in our country now , as he was a year ago , confident that all is going his way , smug in his recent successes , and piously talking about peace , colonialism , and disarmament . But how can you talk of peace , Mr. Khrushchev , when you and your Chinese Communist friends are undermining the peace every day , creating disorder and danger wherever you move ? How can you talk of colonialism when you are surrounded by your puppet dictators and when you hold in an iron grip a great empire stretching from East Berlin to Vietnam ? How can you talk of the achievements of your system , even if you beat us again by putting a man into outer space ? For we know that while you may bring a man back from outer space , you rarely bring one back alive from Siberia .	unknown	As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace .

We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	To provide these jobs , our economy must grow much more rapidly - for today under Republican policies which stop growth we are growing more slowly than every other industrial nation . And it is significant that our prestige all over the world has been declining at the same time that the American economy has been almost stagnant with industries operating at half capacity and unemployment going up and up . Now , how can Government policy help create the jobs we need and provide full employment ? First , we must reverse the tight-money and high-interest-rate policies which have choked off investment and kept the small businessman and farmer from getting the capital they need to survive and expand .	unknown	attack	unemployment

Every time the President vetoes a housing bill , every time a Republican Member votes against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , every time we are unable to get any support on our bill to tie medical care for the aged to social security , it is not the Congress that suffers , it is not the administration ; it is the people of the United States who require , in my opinion , a progressive , forward-looking government if this country is going to move forward . It is no accident that 400,000 people in a rich State like Pennsylvania wait every month for surplus food packages from the Federal Government .	unknown	Why is it that everybody is so tremendously interested in this problem ? Oh , I 'm sure you know , just as I do and all of these great audiences to whom I have talked . They know that we can have the best farm income that we can possibly think of ; we can have the best jobs , the best schools , the best medical care , a splendid social security program , better than any of us have ever dreamed of , and all of these things at home wo n't mean anything at all unless we 're not around to enjoy them .

political	1674	I spelled it out to give you an example of an approach . I could give examples in medical care , in housing , in all the other fields . But I could only summarize by saying this .	unknown	Senator Kennedy added : The aged of this Nation deserve to spend their retirement years with proper recognition and respect for the contributions they have made to the American economy . They should have an income adequate to permit them to continue their important contributions to American life and a program of medical insurance through the social security system for dignified health care . I am proud of the endorsement of these outstanding scientists and practitioners in the field of aging .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ? Nothing at all .	unknown	[ Applause . ] The Republican Party , which in 1935 voted almost unanimously against the 25-cent minimum wage , voted almost unanimously against the $ 1.25 in 1960 . A Republican Party , which in 1935 voted 95 to 1 in the House of Representatives against the social security bill , voted 44 to 1 , with only one Republican , for medical care for the aged in the last session of the Congress .	unknown	support	minimum wage
political	1677	When the economy is not growing , few businesses are looking for new sites in which to locate plants . And when 159 areas of substantial unemployment are competing for the few new plants that are being built , no single area like Scranton can do much on its own . And , what is worse , most economists now agree that another recession is underway .	unknown	if we want jobs , the way is through peace , with peace , and without inflation . And also my opponent knows this : He knows the unemployment figure dropped last month and , you know , a funny thing , that same Detroit paper that carried that story had another eight column headline right below it . You know what it said ?  Car Sales at Alltime High .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	1678	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	In short , the high cost of living hurts almost every American . But its hurts most of all those whom the Republican brand of prosperity has left far behind - the 4 million unemployed , whose jobless insurance check is too low to meet these costs - the 3 million put on a short work week because our growth has slowed down and our major industries ( such as steel and coal and textiles and autos ) are below capacity - the millions earning the bare minimum wage , $ 1 an hour , $ 40 a week - which can not possibly be enough at today 's prices - the millions on an inadequate social security check - the schoolteachers in need of Federal aid - millions of Americans caught in a squeeze of costs rising faster than income - millions of Americans asking for help . Finally , last year , the Republicans decided to do something bold .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1679	For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction .	unknown	And I say that we can not and should not blame ourselves , our policies , our negotiators , their scientific advisers , or their instructions , for the unyielding refusal of the Soviets to make an agreement at Geneva . The time and patience which we have already expended to explore this way out of the disarmament dilemma have been full proof of our own intentions and those of the Soviets . The blame rests squarely on them .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	1681	This administration , a year ago , in order to get a position on disarmament , appointed a lawyer from my own State of Massachusetts , Mr. Coolidge , who had had no previous experience in the field . After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference . One hundred people working on one of the most important , involved , specialized fields the subject of disarmament , nuclear control .	unknown	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1684	I will tell you today the things that I believe are necessary , the program that I stand for . I will tell you , for example , that I think we need economic policies that will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million people , that will increase employment , that we need Government policies , for example , which will provide better guarantees and better protection against unemployment than we presently have . I will tell you today , for example , that I think those policies will produce more economic programs and progress than will the policies of our opponents .	unknown	There are 15 million American homes in the United States which are sub-standard . The average unemployment compensation check in the United States , the richest country on earth , is $ 31 a week , and in some States as little as 8 weeks . The average wage for laundrywomen in five large cities of the United States , and most of them are Negro women , is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1685	Pennsylvania relies on two industries basically : coal mining and steelmaking . Both of these industries have experienced automation , and it is the reason that there is unemployment of 9 percent in this general area of these counties in western Pennsylvania , 9 percent . You have not really recovered in a very real way in the State of Pennsylvania from the recession of 1958 .	unknown	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1686	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	unknown	Today , 100 years later , I come from my native city of Boston to Wisconsin , to tell you that Carl Schurz 's teachings have not been forgotten . That I know , and all Americans realize , that peace and disarmament are remote and difficult goals . But we have chosen them as ideals to guide our actions .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1687	If the people 's interest is going to be protected , the President of the United States must stand for that protection . It is the President of the United States that can set the goals for the country in housing , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , and in equality of rights for all Americans , regardless of their race or color . I stand in direct succession to Truman and Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , who advanced the right of all Americans to participate equally in our society .	unknown	To strengthen our country from within , he promises to move the Federal Government into the very heart of your school system by providing Federal dollars for use to pay the salaries of your teachers , which would inevitably bring Federal control of what is taught . To assure a vital economy , he promises a minimum wage that official studies show would force unemployment and business failures . To protect the unfortunate , he promises to give the wealthiest people in American a helping hand with medical costs in their later years , while withholding help from some 3 million people with incomes of $ 2,000 or less ; in fact , in the name of freedom he would force this medical program on one and all , save the 3 million who need help the most .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1688	A further Federal - State program should be inaugurated at once , designed to help rehabilitate handicapped persons who may never again be able to accept regular employment but who can be brought to the point where they need not be dependent on custodial care . Many older people in hospitals and nursing homes today could care for themselves in the proper setting , if the combined forces of medical care , social service counseling , and other resources were brought to bear on their handicaps . Additional Federal funds should be made available for research and training in the field of rehabilitation , with special emphasis on rehabilitation of older people .	unknown	But I think - I think , in this case , experience does count . I believe in an America where one 's latest years are the good years - years of security and dignity ; where medical care for the aged is provided out of social security - a contribution of less than 3 cents a day during their working years ; where older people can find decent housing , suitable to their needs ; and where doors are not automatically shut in their face by any employer , including the Federal Government , for in those crucial years we need their wisdom and their counsel . I talked recently to a grandmother in Dayton , Ohio , who could not bear to ask her children , with whom she was then living , for the $ 13 a week she needed for medicine , because they were giving so much up to sustain her at that time .	unknown	support	medical care,health care

We will see to it that we have social security and unemployment insurance , that we will extend all of these things that are good for America and that Americans need , but I say to you also , as President , that there will be certainly not one dollar spent that does n't need to be spent . And here you 've got a choice .	unknown	This administration has stood still and so has Richard Nixon for 14 years that I have been in the Congress with him . On all the great issues which disturb our country , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , houses , roads , schools , hospitals , our parties have divided and we have divided , and the great questions for the 1960 's are how is it going to be possible to move this country forward , build its economy , provide employment for its people . And there are 4 ½ million of them out of work today .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

Do you know what the average wage for laundrywomen , and most of them are Negroes , in five large cities of the United States is ? Sixty-five cents an hour for a 48-hour week .	unknown	The principles for which Dwight Eisenhower and I have fought and will continue to fight are the ideals not only of Republicans but of Democrats as well . All through the campaign my opponent has been trumpeting the falsehood that I , in effect , feast on human misery - that I oppose minimum wage , help to distressed areas , social security , medical care for the aged , and all else that concerns the good of the American people . Last week Mr. Kennedy called me the leader of the social security wrecking crew - trying to secure votes from the aged by playing on their fears .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

He tells us now that his trips abroad were a valuable experience - but the facts are that every key area he has visited is less friendly to western views now than it was at the time of his visit : Ghana , Laos , Cuba , Panama , and at least 10 others . The great tragedy of American foreign policy in all of these areas was our failure to recognize the situation before the crisis developed .	unknown	He shot from the hip and said , the President could have apologized , could have expressed regrets . Was he right ? Was the President right ? And the third point , on Cuba . Here again - and here 's where belligerency comes in - the President said we 're going to quarantine this little pipsqueak Castro , and we quarantined him by putting in effect economic restrictions on our trade .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1694	Cuba is not the only example . What I am concerned about is in 1970 I do n't want to see independent country after independent country begin to move where Guinea and Ghana have gone , where the Congo almost went and may still go , where Cuba has already gone , because for a simple reason they feel that the Communists represent the future , they feel that we are identified with the past , they feel that we are identified with colonialism , they feel that we are identified with the kind of future which they do not want . Why ? After all , what we want is their independence .	unknown	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today . Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	unknown	attack	cuba

But who does Mr. Nixon think he fools in the last 3 weeks of an election , who does he think he fools when he says we will have no more debates after this week , as he goes around the country casting his innuendoes , suggesting that we in the Democratic Party are not as devoted to the cause of freedom , implying that for some reason or other we were misled by Khrushchev and he understood him all the time ? I was not the Vice President of the United States who presided over the communization of Cuba . [ Applause .	unknown	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply . And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1696	The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands . But , like the seafaring man on the desert of waters , you choose them as your guides , and following them you will reach your destiny .	unknown	Halt the arms race .  Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	1697	Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring . The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands .	unknown	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return . I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise . I know that that kind of firmness is what leads to peace .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1699	Perhaps the science of inspection will be unable to keep pace with advancing weapons technology . But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament .	unknown	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	unknown	support	disarmament

After passing in the U.S. Senate a bill providing for $ l.25 minimum wage , we failed in the conference to secure the passage of that bill . After passing in the Senate of the United States a bill for aid for education , and a bill for aid for housing , we failed to get both of those bills to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote , and every Republican member of the Rules Committee of the House voted against them going to the floor of the House of Representatives .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage

The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .	unknown	In 1935 , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against social security .

And if they do come in you know what the result is ? It can only mean a civil war in Cuba , which the United States would not avoid entering , and this result could easily be spread into a conflict , into a world war , that every American of both parties wants to avoid ; and I say that Senator Kennedy owes it to the Nation to put the cause of peace and freedom before political consideration and to retract this immature , rash , and dangerous suggestion that he has made . Now , some of you who heard the debate , though , will remember that he said :  But , after all , this is nothing new ,  that we helped , he said , the Castro forces get arms and ammunition in the United States when they were supporting their revolution against Batista .	unknown	But what I do suggest is that at least we have some concern , some recognition , some idea of the changing nature of our times .

The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people . But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .	unknown	We come from all continents , from all countries , from all races and all religions and what better evidence of it than here ? I recall talking to Mr. Herbert Hoover at the time he was working with me on the Hungarian refugee problems , trying to develop programs for the refugees . Concern was expressed at that time about changing our immigration laws to allow more refugees to come in , concern with regard to the effect on employment and unemployment in this country , concern as to how these people could be assimilated . His answer was that every wave of refugees that has come to the United States has strengthened America rather than weakened it .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1722	I have those who have written to me and said ,  Now , Mr. Nixon , you 're a Quaker , you believe in peace . Why is it that you stand against the proposals for disarmament that are made by Mr. Khrushchev ? Why is it that we ca n't go more than halfway on these proposals and take some of them on faith ?  I want to tell you why we ca n't . Because if the United States ever enters into a disarmament agreement with the Soviet or with any other potential aggressor which they might break and which we would keep , that would increase the danger of war rather than reduce it and that we must never do .	unknown	But I know that there is not one person in the State or Nation who would not like to see the arms race ended - the threat of war recede - and the billions now spent on weapons of destruction turned to schools and hospitals and homes and dams . And with imaginative and painstaking planning for reconversion this State would enjoy a greater boom under disarmament than it ever enjoyed in the cold war . For peace is our deepest aspiration .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	1723	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	I want to make it very clear that the differences between Mr. Nixon and myself , the differences between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are clear . Mr. Nixon represents a party , a philosophy which he believes in , which voted against social security and minimum wage and housing and unemployment compensation . The fact of the matter is that the Republican Party controlled the Congress and the Presidency for years and no civil rights bill ever saw the light of day .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1724	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare . At the London Conference of 1957 , the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties , and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament , we sent a man who had not been active in the field , Harold Stassen , we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position . Mr. Stassen was never able to get clear instructions at the meeting as to what our position was .	unknown	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	1725	Take my opponent , for example . He says on the Cuban situation that he did not intend to suggest that the American Government should intervene in the internal affairs of Cuba . And yet the words he used ,  the U.S. Government should support the anti-Castro forces in Cuba  have been interpreted by his friends among the press , by all the people abroad , by all of the allies of the United States , as meaning exactly that .	unknown	[ Applause . ] But I would also like to hear him discuss not just Cuba , but also the United States , Pennsylvania , how we are going to build a strong society here in the United States . I do n't worry about the cause of freedom , I do n't worry about our prestige around the world , our influence around the globe , as long as we are moving here at home .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1726	In short , no problem is more vital or more urgent in the struggle for peace than the problem of effective arms control . Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands .	unknown	The hope for peace is to be firm against those who threaten the peace so that they ca n't blackmail us . The hope for peace is then to go out and sit down , from a position of strength , and negotiate for disarmament for peace but always from strength and never from weakness . And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	1727	We can be proud that we are working through the United Nations to maintain the freedom of these people rather than to take it away . It 's true that President Eisenhower is n't making a fool of himself on the floor of the U.N. It 's true that he is advocating a program for disarmament , for the use of outer space , a program in addition , for the use of our surpluses through the United Nations . All of these are honest , decent proposals , which the whole world applauds .	unknown	There is no sense having a meeting unless there is an atmosphere before the meeting which leads you to hope that there will be some success . On the issues on which we are divided with the Soviet Union , disarmament and Berlin , which are the two chief ones at the present time , there is no indication that there is a common meeting ground . Therefore , just to meet , just to sit down , just to spend an hour , unless there is some basis for hope , particularly as Khrushchev is being extremely belligerent now , I thought the President showed good judgment .	unknown	support	disarmament
political	1728	They 're going to stir up trouble . We 're going to have trouble not only in Cuba but in Japan and all over the world . Why ? Because they 're going to stir them up .	unknown	[ Response from the audience ; applause . ] The fact of the matter is that in the last 8 years not a single Soviet soldier has crossed the frontiers of Russia or their present territory , and yet Cuba , Laos , in part Iraq , their influence in Ghana and Guinea , their influence in Latin America their influence in Africa , their influence in Asia , their influence at the United Nations , their military position , their scientific position , their production of scientists and engineers have all steadily increased in relation to ours , and the judgment that you must make as you sit here in Florida , 90 miles from Cuba , 8 minutes by jet - you have to determine whether you can support the leadership of a candidate and a party which runs on a slogan of  We 've Never Had It So Good .  I do n't run on that slogan .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1729	And Roosevelt and Landon , and Truman and Dewey . Where did they get those candidates ? The Republican Party for 25 years has put up candidates , and , as a party , has taken the position against every piece of progressive legislation that serves the people , from minimum wage to unemployment compensation , to better housing , to aid for education , to more equal rights for all Americans , for a stronger defense for a stronger and more vital society . The Republican Party , ever since it drove Theodore Roosevelt into the wilderness 50 years ago , has stood still .	unknown	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

political	1730	The negotiations on nuclear testing are as far apart as they ever were . The talks on disarmament have been called off . And , finally , instead of the hoped-for general relaxation of world tension , the Soviets have stepped up the tempo of disorder , division and danger .	unknown	Let me just make this one point . We will always go the extra mile to negotiate , We will always make over every proposal and take every initiative , as President Eisenhower did , on disarmament , on open skies , on the use of outer space for peaceful purposes in his U.N. speech . But , on the other hand , if we really want peace , my friends , the way to destroy our hopes is for the United States ever to agree to disarm when the Russians are n't also doing it .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	1732	I represent a section of the United States , New England , which has had the same problem that upper New York has had , defense contracts leaving , industries laying off , and we have begun to bring them back , particularly in electronics and in the Raytheon Co. I think defense contracts should be fairly distributed across the Nation . I also support the reestablishment of the Defense Manpower Policy No.4, which was thrown out in 1952 , which provided that those defense contracts would go to those areas which were able to meet the competitive price and had over 8 percent unemployment . I think we can use defense contracts to strengthen the economy as well as strengthen the country .	unknown	One last point I would like to make as far as recession is concerned : I think we can do some other things that will smooth out the business cycle . One in particular is with regard to unemployment compensation . I think that unemployment compensation - our unemployment compensation principles and programs - should be revised , so that we can have a more effective method .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment
political	1734	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .	unknown	Mr. Nixon says that is extreme . Minimum wage , housing , education , strengthening the United States - that is our program and I would like your help in it . Thank you .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1735	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	unknown	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare .

The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	unknown	I wonder if he is going to be smiling November 9 ? [ Response from the audience . ] The fact of the matter is , as Congressman Flood knows , that the party that voted 90 percent against the $ 1.25 minimum wage voted 90 percent in the midthirties against 25 cents . The party that voted against medical care for the aged , 90 percent in 1960 , voted 90 percent against the social security in the midthirties .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1740	It is the kind of problem that is difficult of solution , but it is the kind of problem that the Republicans never think about . They have never concerned themselves in the last 25 years with the problems of employment , of social security , of housing , of minimum wage , of social justice , of equality of treatment , of aid to education , of a stronger better America , to which we are committed . So I come here to Pennsylvania a State which has not gone Democratic in a presidential election for 20 years , and I come here and ask your belp in this campaign .	unknown	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .

The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1742	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	unknown	But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership . Their aim has been : ( 1 ) To block the minimum wage bill ( which in its first year of operation would have raised the wages of an estimated 1 million Negro workers ) , the aged health care , housing , and education bills ( which also would have meant major advances in the rights of our lower income and minority group members ) . A majority of Republicans voted against the minimum wage bill , all but one voted against social security health care for the aged and not one Republican on the House Rules Committee was ready to let adequate education and housing bills come up for final action .	unknown	attack	medical care,health care
political	1743	He made this motion to table at a time when we had unlimited time to consider the measure . These bills - housing , education , medical help , and minimum wage - are vitally important to millions of American - Negroes and whites because they affect all those Americans who are on the lower level of our economic ladder . I strongly support civil rights and I am wholeheartedly committed to the implementation of the platform , but to use civil rights at this time as a method of defeating other bills whose passage are also essential would have meant that the session would have ended in complete failure .	unknown	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage

I think it is .	unknown	One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally .

In the novel  On the Beach ,  the lone American survivors of world war III are standing on a beach in Australia , awaiting the inevitable end from the spreading cloud of radioactivity .	unknown	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply .

political	1747	For I believe that we must act to eliminate discrimination in employment if a growing America is to serve as a living example of freedom to all the world . Sixth , we must formulate special programs to those areas of our country which are suffering from severe economic distress and chronic unemployment . Today , the country has 126 areas of substantial labor surplus - areas like Bay City , Flint , and the Iron Range - areas of declining industry - where there is poverty and hunger - where men have been searching for work , but can not find work .	unknown	That was the Truman recession of 1949 .

Now , let 's look at some of these programs , and particularly one that will be of great interest to this audience here , the program of medical care for the aged . We stand for a program which recognizes this program , recognizes it because we know that all of our families in this country want to see to it that our older citizens not only are well cared for , but that they have the opportunity to get care particularly when illnesses of serious nature strike .	unknown	But I can take no satisfaction in them . I can take no satisfaction in coming to this valley and seeing pottery mills , seeing steel mills working part time , seeing rivers that are polluted , seeing an administration which has twice vetoed the area redevelopment bill , which has vetoed a hill to clean our rivers , which has vetoed twice in the last 12 months a housing bill , which considers $ 1.25 minimum wage an extreme , which considers medical care for the aged as extreme , and I quote Mr. Nixon accurately .

He tells us now that his trips abroad were a valuable experience - but the facts are that every key area he has visited is less friendly to western views now than it was at the time of his visit : Ghana , Laos , Cuba , Panama , and at least 10 others . The great tragedy of American foreign policy in all of these areas was our failure to recognize the situation before the crisis developed .	unknown	And , worse still , it would have meant surrender at the conference table .

This is an issue which is just beginning , but it is the kind of all issue which I think the Democratic Party recognizes .	unknown	 This letter from this 12-year-old boy sums up the concern that I found all over the United States as we have traveled this country north , east , west , and south . This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

To protect the unfortunate , he promises to give the wealthiest people in American a helping hand with medical costs in their later years , while withholding help from some 3 million people with incomes of $ 2,000 or less ; in fact , in the name of freedom he would force this medical program on one and all , save the 3 million who need help the most .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament

We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	unknown	Today , 100 years later , I come from my native city of Boston to Wisconsin , to tell you that Carl Schurz 's teachings have not been forgotten .

For example , the very quick way that he went to work on asking the legislature to provide for West Virginia 's participation in the new program for medical care for the aged . This is typical of a man of action , a young , vigorous leader of West Virginia .	unknown	We can go back to the August session of this Congress when there were three bills , which I think tell very well what the issues are in this campaign . One was medical care for the aged tied to social security . Forty-four Democratic Senators supported it , only one Republican , and it is a fact that in the last 7 days the Governor of this State , a Republican , has attacked the program which was passed in this last session of the Congress , because it was not tied to social security .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

How is it possible for us , who initiated the first atomic advance - how is it possible for us to make a decisive breakthrough in this area ? Because of experiments now going on in Western Germany , it appears likely that almost 20 countries will have an atomic capacity by 1965 . China , Egypt , Cuba - all the rest of them , all possessing atomic weapons , all possessing a hydrogen capacity perhaps all possessing ballistic missiles , and the means of delivering them . When we realize that war has been the constant companion of mankind through the ages , we are about to move into a period of history when any country or combination of countries can destroy themselves , their adversaries , and perhaps the human race , all in the next 10 years .	unknown	The question can be stated this way :  What should the U.S. Government do about Castro ?  I favor an economic and political quarantine as outlined in my American Legion speech . Specifically you state that  We must attempt to strengthen the non-Batista democratic anti-Castro forces in exile , and in Cuba itself who offer eventual hope of overthrowing Castro . Thus far these fighters for freedom have had virtually no support from our Government .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1788	Put your thumb down regardless of what you do . We are fighting a candidate , the Republican Party , that for 20 years has opposed what the people need , minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation . The real issue is which party and which candidate can best strengthen the United States , can best serve the public interest .	unknown	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	attack	minimum wage

Seventh and finally , we must restore full employment to our schedule of national priorities - striving - for a more rapid growth of the American economy - building purchasing power through better minimum wage and unemployment compensation laws - having faith in America 's capacity to eventually provide a productive job for every man who wants to work . This is our program - a program which can help transform the threat of automation into the promise of abundance - a program which will require leadership inspired by both compassion and courage - a program which will require from labor , management , and Government a willingness to accept new concepts , new burdens and new risks to meet the challenge of automation 's new frontier .	unknown	They talked .

political	1791	And , so , today I think the first test you must put to the presidential candidate is , Are their policies the ones that will move America forward ? Move her in what way ? So that the American economy will grow and prosper , get jobs , higher wages for our people ; so that our schools and our school system can improve in quality ; so that our teachers can be better paid ; so that our standards can be raised ; so that we will have adequate classrooms , better education . We want better health care . All of these things - health , education , housing , jobs - which spell progress , we want for America , and I tell you today that in these fields I stand for programs that I believe will produce the greatest progress that America has ever had , a program that will expand our economy and create more jobs - not Government jobs , but jobs in private industry , which people want ; programs which will build more schools and release funds so that we can raise the salaries of our teachers , as they should be raised ; programs in the field of medical care for the aged , for example , which will provide that every person over 65 who wants health insurance can get it ; that everyone who ought to have it is encouraged to get it , but that no one who does not want it is forced to get it against his will , because that is the American principle .	unknown	( Response from the audience . ) Mr. Nixon considers medical care for the aged tied to social security to be , and I quote him accurately ,  too extreme .

But we will not move toward disarmament and a secure peace , we will not be any closer to freedom from fear , if we simply follow Mr. Nixon 's plan for meetings , more conferences , more study groups and discussions . For peace takes more than words .	unknown	They want to go Eisenhower 's way - and that 's our way , and that 's the way we 're going . Now , the last point that I make is one that I make particularly because I know of the great concern the people in these university communities have for the cause of disarmament .

I know what it is for a family to attempt to meet the bills at the end of the month .	unknown	[ Applause . ] And we will enact a bill which has passed the U.S. Senate twice , which has been vetoed twice , which provides assistance to those who live in distressed areas , which will help send Government contracts , which will provide loans for businessmen , which will provide vocational retraining , which will provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits , so that in these distressed areas where unemployment is 8 , 9 , and 10 percent , we can help these places move again .

You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	unknown	I think for the last 8 years we have had a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference . As long as there are 15 million Americans living in substandard housing , as long as the average unemployment compensation check for workers thrown out of work in this country is $ 32 a week , as long as there are millions of Americans who do not even receive the inadequate $ 1 an hour minimum wage , as long as the average check for laundry women in five large cities of this country is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week , as long as there are 4 million families receiving a food surplus package from our Government every month , so long is there need for the Democratic Party .

We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	I know that the American labor movement wants for America what I want for America : the elimination of poverty and unemployment , the reestablishment of America 's position of leadership in the world , the end of racial discrimination everywhere in our society .

Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force . His pessimistic talk today recalls to my mind the situation in 1953 when the Eisenhower administration assumed responsibility for the Nation 's affairs .	unknown	A real  truth squad ,  for example , would find it necessary to ask Mr. Nixon such questions as these : 1. Why do you repeat the statement that real wages have gone up 15 percent during the present administration compared with only 2 percent in the previous one , when your own Department of Labor figures clearly establish that the increase between September 1945 ( the first postwar month ) and January 1953 was 18.3 percent while the increase between January 1953 and August 1960 has been 13.7 percent . 2. Why have you not personally admitted that you misquoted me when you said that in my Detroit speech on Labor Day I had said  What the American labor movement wants for America is what I want for America  when this statement did not appear in either my advance statement or in the speech as actually delivered ? 3. When you insist that Federal aid to teachers salaries means Federal control over education , are you aware of the fact that the present program for aid to federally impacted areas has been free of such control , and that the provision which you killed with your tie-breaking vote contained explicit language ruling out any Federal  direction , supervision , or control over the policy determinations , personnel , program of instruction , or the administration or operation of any school or school system  ? 4. How can you claim credit for the present administration for more new water project starts than any other time in our history , when the stated Republican position except in campaign election years has been a no-new-starts policy that the Democratic Congress has sought to overcome ? 5. How can you call the vetoed 1960 Democratic bill on depressed areas  straight pork barrel  when your own Secretary of Labor , just 24 hours before the veto was announced , called the bill  good enough so that any Senator or Congressman from a State with areas of chronic unemployment would have no alternative but vote for it  ? 6. Why do you take credit for the present levels of operations at the National Institutes of Health , when the Democratic Congress , ignoring threats of veto , raised the administration request from $ 400 million to $ 560 million for the present year - the sixth consecutive year that Democrats have raised administration requests ? 7.

You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	unknown	In short , the high cost of living hurts almost every American . But its hurts most of all those whom the Republican brand of prosperity has left far behind - the 4 million unemployed , whose jobless insurance check is too low to meet these costs - the 3 million put on a short work week because our growth has slowed down and our major industries ( such as steel and coal and textiles and autos ) are below capacity - the millions earning the bare minimum wage , $ 1 an hour , $ 40 a week - which can not possibly be enough at today 's prices - the millions on an inadequate social security check - the schoolteachers in need of Federal aid - millions of Americans caught in a squeeze of costs rising faster than income - millions of Americans asking for help .

Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it .

We failed to secure passage of a bill connected with the Forand bill , tying medical care for the aged to social security . Instead of the bill that was finally passed we received the support of one Republican Senator , Senator Case of New Jersey , and we were threatened by a Presidential veto .	unknown	I 'm proud of that record , and we have a program that will produce greater progress and greater prosperity on those issues for America in the future , I can assure you . But may I say it would n't be enough to rest our case there because , you know , you can have the best jobs , the best social security , the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy it .

In the case of the $ 1.25 minimum wage , which was my bill , which we did pass in the Senate by a vote of 2 to 1 , we failed in the conference with the House , after Mr. Dirksen , the minority leader , announced that the President of the United States would veto any bill that had $ 1.25 minimum wage .

And do we lose prestige when in Cuba , where we have all the power in the world , we do not use the power , but we work through an Organization of American States to attempt to bring that country back into the paths of freedom ?

Well , for the reasons I 'm sure you 've already guessed .

We can no longer tolerate growing patches of poverty and injustice in America - substandard wages , unemployment , city slums , inadequate medical care , inferior education and the sad plight of migratory workers . The enactment of this bill is only one step , but an essential step forward , as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation .	unknown	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	unrelated	unemployment

Already 2 1/4 million of our older citizens must rely on public assistance for their daily needs .	unknown	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	unknown	unrelated	medical care,health care

He comes up , as I pointed up , with the fantastic recommendation that the U.S. Government shall directly aid the anti-Castro forces both in and out of Cuba . Now , every freedom-loving person in the United States - let 's make it clear - is in sympathy with the democratic anti-Castro forces in Cuba and outside Cuba . We want them to win .	unknown	Secondly , how is it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union and France and Britain to come to a conclusion to cease nuclear testing with some worthwhile inspection system ? How is it possible for us , who initiated the first atomic advance - how is it possible for us to make a decisive breakthrough in this area ? Because of experiments now going on in Western Germany , it appears likely that almost 20 countries will have an atomic capacity by 1965 . China , Egypt , Cuba - all the rest of them , all possessing atomic weapons , all possessing a hydrogen capacity perhaps all possessing ballistic missiles , and the means of delivering them .

This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	unknown	attack	unemployment

Why have you stated that I support a minimum wage which  official studies show would force unemployment and business failures  when there are no such studies , just administration assertion that this might happen - assertions like those made by Republicans every time an increase in the minimum wage is proposed ? 10 .

But anyone who believes as I do that this country will never be strong in the world , that we will never be successful in turning Mr. Khrushchev back , we will never be successful in expanding freedom around the world unless we have in this country a strong and vital and progressive society , and that is what we are committed to , that is what we are committed to , and I believe the American people on November 8 , faced with a choice of a leadership that looks to the past and the present , and recognizing that this country , the only hope of freedom that there is , we are the only sentinel at the gate , and if we do n't move ahead , if we do n't provide employment for our people , if we do n't use our facilities to the fullest , if we do n't educate our children and provide under social security medical care for our aged and jobs for those in between , then the United States , instead of being the leader of the free world , will cease to count as the only hope of freedom .

But it is equally true that , if we put our economy to work - if we achieve the rate of 4- to 5-percent growth every year that is within our reach - then we will have the added resources to devote to schools and hospitals and medical care for the aged , housing , and conservation .

In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .	unknown	But both of them lived many , many years longer , and both of them , the longer they lived , gained love and affection from the American people - and I would only hope tonight that , however this election turns out , Senator Kennedy and I in the years ahead will be able to conduct ourselves with the dignity , the decency which earned the esteem and the love of the American people for the two men who were engaged in that great campaign of 1928 .

Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	unknown	[ Applause . ] I do not believe that a political party which in the last 25 years has opposed housing and , minimum wage and social security and every great domestic program which has been identified with progress in this country , which has refused to recognize our changing times around the world , which liquidated the credit which Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman built up in Latin America , which has shown itself wholly uninformed of the present revolution now taking place in Africa , which has failed to maintain our military strength , which has given almost no attention to the important subject of disarmament , having less than 100 people working on it in the entire Federal Government , which has permitted us to be second , best in outer space , which has brought less foreign students to study here today than 10 years ago , which has , in other words , presided over the United States in a changing time and refused to change - I believe on November 8 the people of this country are going to take progress for the future , are going to give the leadership of this country once more to the Democrats .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	Mr. Nixon leads the same party that voted 90 percent against the social security in the midthirties and vote 90 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security in 1960 .

Now , he 's entitled to his opinion , and may I say he 's entitled to his mistakes , but we can not afford a man who will make mistakes like that as President of the United States of America , because , you see , the difficulty is when you 're a candidate and you make mistakes , you can correct them , as he has tried to correct his ; but once you are President , you will find that then you must , as you confront these great problems , make the judgment on the spot which will avoid that critical mistake that would give to those who are the enemies of freedom the advantage that they want .	unknown	Mr. Nixon chose to devote his speech here to Cuba .

It is particularly appropriate that we mark that anniversary by the extension of the system to include medical care insurance for our older citizens . A quarter of a century ago , the people of the United States turned their back on the dole and the means test , and chose instead to rely on self-financed insurance , paid through the social security system , to protect themselves against the hazards of old age .	unknown	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care .

We 're strong enough . Why do n't we move into the Congo as Khrushchev did , unilaterally ? Why do n't we go into Cuba unilaterally , on our own , instead of working through all the rest of the American States as we have ?  And the answer is this : The United States can not and must not do this because if we are going to have real peace and real security in the world , we must have other free nations and other peace-loving nations working with us , rather than against us . And we must set an ideal - an ideal which they will follow - an ideal that we will work with these organizations to see that things that otherwise would be settled on the battlefield , are settled at the conference table .	unknown	No.2, until our relations with Cuba became so sour that we broke off the sugar quota , the United States almost ignored the needs of Latin America for long-term capital .

As a result of this failure we have been steadily unprepared on disarmament .	unknown	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war .

( 4 ) Unemployment : Mr. Nixon , who thinks several million unemployed is inevitable and nothing to worry about , is satisfied today with what he calls our  unprecedented prosperity  - but I think we can do better in putting our unemployed back to work , using our idle capacity in steel , coal and other industries , and finding jobs for the thousands of young men and women who are pouring into our labor market every week of the year . ( 5 ) Trusting the voters : Mr. Nixon and the Republicans are unwilling to reveal to the American people reports containing the facts about our prestige , the truth about the Nixon - Khrushchev talks , the basis of the present missile gap as contained in the Gaither report , and the facts about whether we are heading for a third recession prepared by the Department of Commerce .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	1868	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .	unknown	First , it has been suggested that it is your objective to pose as a champion of disarmament .

political	1870	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	We only need a few more . A shift of four or five votes in the House last June would have enacted a real minimum wage bill , with coverage for several million more families and a minimum of $ 1.25 an hour .

Now the reason that it is vitally important that we continue to press forward until there is obviously no chance of success is that if we can get an agreement on nuclear testing , suspension of nuclear testing , with inspection , it opens the door and paves the way for disarmament with inspection . And this must be the goal of the President of the United States , whatever party he may be from .	unknown	Mr. Nixon may now say he has been urging an acceleration of our defense all along - but in his August 10 press conference the President said he knew of no such different viewpoint by the Vice President , adding :  Certainly if there is , he has n't come to me about it .

Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina , Hungary , Suez , Sputnik , the riots in Venezuela , the collapse of the summit , the riots in Japan , the collapse of the Baghdad Pact , the failure of disarmament , the U-2 fiasco , and now Cuba and the Congo ? Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report , the Killian report , and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance : for  Atoms for Peace  was a slogan , the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce , the  open skies  plan was a gesture , and the Baghdad Pact was a failure .

political	1885	[ Applause . ] If the United States is going to maintain its position of being a friend of freedom in Latin America , if we are going to be successful in this struggle which is now going on , not merely on the island of Cuba , but all over Latin America , we have to be identified , not merely in the fight against communism , but in the fight against poverty and disease , in the fight that those people are waging for a better life for themselves , and in my judgment the United States is not now in their minds identified with that fight . If we lose that psychological struggle , if Castro or his counterparts in other countries of Latin America are able to suggest that we are indifferent , that we are rich , that we are prosperous , that we do not look at their problems , I believe the future of Latin America will be far different than it could be if we identify ourselves as Franklin Roosevelt did with their problems , with their opportunities and join with them .	unknown	These are the times that you can read and have the time to read that you will never have later , and you can get the opportunity to specialize much later .

For despite the bleak poverty that grips nearly all of Latin America - with an average income of less than $ 285 a year - with an exploding population that threatens even this meager standard of living - yet our aid programs have continued to concentrate on wasteful military assistance until we made a sudden recognition of their needs for development capital practically at the point of Mr. Castro 's gun .	unknown	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today .

Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	unknown	A recent independent survey concluded : The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research efforts .

You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	unknown	We secured the support of seven or eight or nine Republicans on these bills . Senator Javits and others voted with us on minimum wage , housing , and aid to education . But they are only about an eighth or a seventh of the total Republican membership of the Senate .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	1894	Today , the country has 126 areas of substantial labor surplus - areas like Bay City , Flint , and the Iron Range - areas of declining industry - where there is poverty and hunger - where men have been searching for work , but can not find work . Unemployment in any of these areas harms the entire Nation , depriving all our industry of markets , decreasing total purchasing power , and depriving us of needed production . The distress may be regional , but the problem is a national problem .	unknown	In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million . Let 's face it : It took war to solve the unemployment riddle for them . After the war was over opposition spokesmen forecast some 6 million unemployed .	unknown	attack	unemployment
political	1895	I wonder if he is going to be smiling November 9 ? [ Response from the audience . ] The fact of the matter is , as Congressman Flood knows , that the party that voted 90 percent against the $ 1.25 minimum wage voted 90 percent in the midthirties against 25 cents . The party that voted against medical care for the aged , 90 percent in 1960 , voted 90 percent against the social security in the midthirties .	unknown	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	unknown	unrelated	minimum wage
political	1897	By demonstrating that you are able and willing to assume your responsibilities on the local level , that you can be alert to the future needs of our citizens , that you can emphasize cooperation , instead of duplication , with other local governments , you have demonstrated your readiness to join with leaders at every level of government , and in both political parties , to make this a better , wiser , stronger America . Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , tonight expressed strong satisfaction with the minimum wage bill , voted by the Senate 62 to 34 . The minimum wage bill , as passed by the Senate today , will extend protection of the minimum wage and the overtime requirements to approximately 4 million additional employees and will also provide for an increase to $ 1.25 in the existing minimum wage .	unknown	They talked . But what did they produce ? They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ? Nothing at all .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1899	And this administration has failed to recognize the decisive nature of what science is doing to our hopes for the future . This administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire national administration on the subject of disarmament . We have gone into every conference unprepared .	unknown	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing . My friends , that 's a pretty good score in football .	unknown	attack	disarmament
political	1901	I want to thank you very much . We fought in the last Congress for a bill to provide $ 1.25 minimum wage for restaurant employees , retail stores and all the rest . Mr. Nixon says it is extreme .	unknown	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1902	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	unknown	Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , tonight expressed strong satisfaction with the minimum wage bill , voted by the Senate 62 to 34 . The minimum wage bill , as passed by the Senate today , will extend protection of the minimum wage and the overtime requirements to approximately 4 million additional employees and will also provide for an increase to $ 1.25 in the existing minimum wage . The bill which passed the Senate provides for new coverage for employees of retail and retail service enterprises having annual gross sales of a million dollars or more , for employees in laundries with an annual gross sales of a million dollars , for local transit workers , seamen , telephone operators , and employees engaged in fish processing .	unknown	attack	minimum wage
political	1903	These are the times that you can read and have the time to read that you will never have later , and you can get the opportunity to specialize much later . You can learn about political science by participating in political organizations , and I would say certainly a political science course under the very able people who instruct you in our colleges and universities is worth while , but particularly to those who want to enter public service , if I could leave just one note - Remember , that while the broad background in the humanities and history and literature would seem to be very remote from the problems of Ghana and Cuba , from the problems of what we do about health care and what we do about the filibuster , remember those are the courses that will give you the judgment and the depth that is needed to react properly and intelligently to these great issues when they come before you years later , if you happen to enter public life . The last point that I would make is this : I want everybody here to certainly feel the necessity for , as I put it , going into politics ; I do n't mean all of you should run for office .	unknown	I do not know how he can seek the Presidency and avoid explaining what happened in this major foreign policy disaster . But it did happen - and the question now is , What do we do about Cuba and Castro now ? What can a new administration do to end this drift ? 1. The first thing we have to do is let the Cuban people know our determination that they will someday again be free . We did not make clear to the Cubans our devotion to freedom during the brutal reign of the Batista dictatorship - and we are not making our position any clearer under the Castro dictatorship .	unknown	unrelated	cuba
political	1904	To pass them by - to water down the help they need - or merely assume that prosperity at the top will someday reach them - shocks the conscience of those who care . The increases in purchasing power resulting from a higher minimum wage will help to restore consumer demand required to put our idle industrial capacity back to work . The elimination of unfair competition based upon substandard wages will protect fairminded employers anxious to maintain fair labor standards .	unknown	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .

political	1906	I 'm confident of what America can do in the years ahead , provided that Americans know the problems , face up to the challenge , and stay true to the principles that have made this country great . Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well .	unknown	Well , let me say that in the first place I think his purpose in coming here could be manifold . First , he may have some new proposals on disarmament which he hopes to capture the attention of the world with . Second I think he thinks that the General Assembly of the United Nations is going to be increasingly influential and powerful .	unknown	unrelated	disarmament
political	1907	But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace .	unknown	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return . I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise . I know that that kind of firmness is what leads to peace .	unknown	support	disarmament
